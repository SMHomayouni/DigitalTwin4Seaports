To achieve this, there have been attempts to combine existing, disjointed systems into more efficient, standardized platforms that can be scaled up. However, this transition has faced challenges. To address these issues, it is suggested that innovative technologies such as blockchain be utilized due to their alignment with the sector’s needs. This study uses a triangulation approach by examining a mix of literature, web-based data, applications, and projects to showcase the contribution of blockchain and its potential use cases. We also explore its potential use cases based on other sectors using projection and parallelism. Additionally, the study delves into limitations and possible solutions. This research acts as a preliminary study for the implementation of blockchain in the maritime industry, and advocates for its use as a revolutionary approach. The findings will be beneficial for scholars, policy makers, and practitioners in the maritime industry. © 2023 by the authors.",blockchain; connected ports; decentralized technologies; maritime sector; shipping industry; smart port,,Haropa Port,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152802780

Inevitably, the scenario in line with the global warming issues as being highly mentioned by world-bodies such as the United Nations (UN) on climate change, etc. Recently the statistics on earth surface temperature point towards high record temperatures that lead to sea-level rise and degradation of land surface area, in general. These situations caused other spatial objects (land and marine properties) to be affected by their physical properties’ changes (including geometries and locations). Thus, this paper attempts to review various aspects related to digital twins of land and marine spatial objects with respect to issues and challenges of multiple data acquisition techniques considering accuracy, data standard, seamless and integrated georeferenced data within the scenario as being reported in the 6th IPCC document. The situation warrants us to explore different types of land and marine properties (static and dynamic) where static properties are defined as immovable objects and vice versa for the dynamic environment.

It is an innovative concept in smart manufacturing, envisioning improved efficiency, productivity, flexibility and quality control through real-time data-driven and collaborative digital systems. DT systems are enabled through technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), human-machine interface (HMI), simulation models, augmented reality and virtual reality, online sensing, big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additive manufacturing (AM) is a fast-growing and revolutionary technology with immense applications in aerospace, biomedical, automobile and marine applications. Some of the fundamental challenges of AM processes are part irregularities, indispensable post-processing, unanticipated process anomalies, design and metrology disintegration and a lack of standardization. Currently, considerable time and cost are being devoted to offline metrology, defect identification and process optimization. DT-driven AM is still in its nascent stage; however, the technology has demonstrated its immense potential to transform the emerging world of AM. A DT system looks to systematically address these fundamental shortcomings through computational intelligence and real-time data communication. Key application domains include anomaly detection, online condition monitoring, feed-forward process control, intelligent post-processing and process optimization. The chapter critically analyses the current state-of-the-art of DTs in AM processes and further discusses their future prospects and research directions. The chapter highlights the capacity of a DT to broaden the acceptability of AM in various industrial applications by improving robustness and efficiency. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Parnika Shrivastava, Anil Dhanola, and Kishor Kumar Gajrani individual chapters.",,,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176877863

The growth in maritime logistics particularly necessitates a large volume of energy supply in order to maintain the operation of sea trade, resulting in an imbalance between generation and demand sides. Future projections for three major concerns show an increase in load demand, cost of operation, and environmental issues. In order to overcome these problems, integrating microgrids as an innovative technology in the seaport power system appears to be a vital strategy. It is believed that microgrids enhance seaport operation by providing sustainable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective energy. Although microgrids are well established and widely used in a variety of operations on land, their incorporation into the seaport is still limited. The involvement of a variety of heavy loads such as all-electric ships, cranes, cold ironing, and buildings infrastructure renders it a complicated arrangement task in several aspects, which necessitates further research and leaves space for improvement. In this paper, an overview of the seaport microgrids in terms of their concepts and operation management is presented. It provides the perspectives for integrating the microgrid concept into a seaport from both shore side and seaside as a smart initiative for the green port's vision.

Where the results of these techniques are matched with the data stored in the cloud database, this work is considered an Internet of Things application.

Developing a sustainable maritime transportation system and its beneficial electrification as a proven approach in emissions reduction are gathering momentum due to technological growth. Global containerization leads to high electricity demand at container terminals, and the electricity demand is highly dynamic and dependent on different operation processes. The approach of this paper is to forecast the hourly peak load demand and short-term electricity demand profile in a container terminal. The correctly forecasted electricity demand profile is crucial for less expensive and reliable power operation and planning. First, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method is used to predict the container terminal baseload demand. Second, worst-case simultaneous peak load is estimated. Third, the day-ahead load profile is modeled based on the handling operation scheduled for the day. The approach is implemented at the container terminal in Port of Gävle, and the results, including the baseload forecasting, the peak power demand, and the hourly load profile modeling by 2030, have been used in dialogue with the local energy company for the future predicted need of load. © 2021 IEEE.",container terminal; data analysis; electricity consumption; electricity forecasting; electrification; neural network; peak demand; short-term load prediction; smart ports,Containers; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Emission control; Neural networks; Port terminals; Ports and harbors; Railroad yards and terminals; Base-loads; Container terminal; Electrical demand; Electricity demands; Electricity forecasting; Electricity-consumption; Neural-networks; Peak demand; Short term load predictions; Smart port; Forecasting,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123926623

Knowledge of accurate and high-integrity positioning is therefore not only a need for future automated shipping but a base for today's safe navigation. Examples on accidents include Ever Given in the Suez Canal and HNoMS Helge Ingstad in Norway. A Network-RTK (NRTK) service can be used as an augmentation technique to improve performance of shipborne GNSS receivers for future positioning of manned and unmanned vessels in restricted areas, such as port areas, fairways, and inland water ways. NRTK service providers generate RTK corrections based on the observations of networks of GNSS reference stations which enables the users to determine their position with centimeter accuracy in real-time using a shipborne GNSS receiver. Selection of appropriate communication channels for dissemination of NRTK corrections data is the key to a secure positioning (localization) service. In PrePare-Ships project, the modern maritime communication system VDES (VHF Data Exchange System) is proposed to distribute SWEPOS (NRTK in Sweden) correction data to shipborne positioning modules. VDES is a very reliable technique and it is compatible with most onboard functionalities. In order to minimize the impact on the overall VDES data capacity in a local area, NRTK correction data shall only occupy a single VDES slot with a net capacity of 650 bytes. Update rates may vary but are preferably at 1Hz. However, NRTK correction data size changes instantly, depending on the number of visible GNSS satellites, and the data rate can therefore sometimes reach in excess of 1000 byte/s. In this study, a smart technique is proposed to reduce size of NRTK correction data to instantly adapt with the VDES requirements by choosing a combination of specific signals, satellites or even constellations such that the data rate is not more than 650 byte/s, and at the same time it achieves optimal positioning performance with the accuracy required by the PrePare-Ships project application.",,,European GNSS Agency under the European Union [870239]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [870239] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,Article,,,,

The unorganized mechanism of truck traffic flow had caused severe congestion and increased the waiting time of containers transporting trucks both inside and outside the port. Also, the insufficiency of the container storage area had contributed to the reduction in the ship traffic and the unavailability of area for the basic infrastructure needed to accommodate and store the overstocked shipments inside the port. The objective of this study was to set the cornerstone of 2035 vision of a fully automated Kuwaiti Port. An automated Smart Gate was used to reduce the time required for both the passage of cargo and customs inspection. A LEED-certified warehouse was designed that earned 75 points scoring a gold certificate. A smart gate operating system by Camco Group was used to provide a smart portal that integrates the functions of both the port and customs administration. This will make it easier for the port customers and truck drivers to facilitate entry and exit procedures.

When it comes to high-performance ports, this technology becomes even more important. One example is smart ports, which use state-of-the-art ICT applications to completely revamp container and vessel management. Strengthening national economic sustainability and global competitiveness are both impacted by this invention. Reducing the environmental impact of the maritime transport business is no easy feat. In this study, we take a look at how seaport microgrids are becoming more important in the quest for environmentally friendly marine transportation. We take a look at the major problems that contemporary seaports are facing, such as the ever-increasing need for energy, the contamination of both the air and water from ship emissions and the unpredictable cost of electricity. The goal is to bring together current information about smarter ports by giving examples and to encourage new ideas and research in this field. As part of our efforts to inspire new research into smart port development, we also outline certain open questions that need answering.

From the point of view of the development of new technologies, it seems that everything is possible, for example the bringing of so‐ called”intelligent ships” and “smart ports” into one global system on base of internet of things and big data applications. However, if to look at the matter further, a number of factors and obstacles may appear which could be major threats to the normal functioning of such a system. While it is clear that systems with such high degree of complexity are even technically vulnerable, it seems to the author of this paper that questions that are no less difficult are in the field of human relations. For example, when ships and ports are becoming more and more “smarter” and need less and less people to intervene in their interactions, who at the end will be responsible for everything that can and definitely will happened at sea or in the port? What about liability of cargo carrier if “carrier” is an autonomous ship without any person on‐board during the entire journey? How to ensure cyber security? How to be secured against the risks of so‐called artificial intelligence systemic errors? It is possible that only new non‐trivial approaches can lead to acceptable results in this area, but what they may be and whether these approaches are possible at all ‐ these questions are still waiting for answers. © 2019, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

Nowadays, current software and hardware allow exploring innovative ways, although each methodology cannot be considered apart from an adequate onboard monitoring system. In this work, the effects of several typical degradations of a ship's engine, affecting some parameters that can be monitored on board, have been supposed and analyzed in order to their detection at an early stage by processing some parameters that can be monitored on board. The main aim is to provide a tool able to trace the engine performance decay. The procedure is based on the simulation of the engine model performed with input data measured on board and on a comparison of the outcomes with the real data. The case study is a 12.000 kW (750 rpm) 4-stroke marine diesel engine, simulated in a Matlab/Simulink environment and validated through the manufacturer's datasheet. At this stage of the research, to make up for the lack of experimental data recorded onboard, a more detailed engine simulator is used to generate onboard data, with some alterations of the operating conditions as, intercooler efficiency and loss of pressure, turbocharger fouling, and many others. The numerical diagnostic tool acts on the minimization of the mean square errors (optimization problem) between the measured and the numerically simulated engine variables (such as pressures, temperatures, etc..) by properly varying the model parameters. The state of the engine is evaluated by analyzing the offset between the parameters of the degraded model and those obtained through the identification procedure for the degraded case.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

There is a real need to understand energy usage in fishery ports to help identify areas of improvements, with a view to optimize energy usage and minimize carbon emissions. In this study, we elaborate on ways in which a simulation capability can be developed at the community level with a fishery port, using a real-world case study seaport in Milford Heaven (Wales, UK). This simulation-based strategy is used to investigate the potential of renewable energy, including local solar farms, to meet the local power demand. This has informed the development of a simulation-based optimization strategy meant to explore how smart energy communities can be formed at the port level by integrating the smart grid with the local community energy storage. The main contribution of the paper involves a co-simulation environment that leverages calibrated energy simulation models to deliver an optimization capability that (a) manages electrical storage within a district an environment, and (b) promotes the formation of energy communities in a fishery port ecosystem.

As a key element of smart port, the ACT is an important terminal operating facility for import/export and transshipment cargo between countries and must have facilities with sufficient capacity to load/unload export/import cargo in a timely manner according to the user’s request. Recently, the method of calculating the capacity of seaport infrastructure is changing from the method of applying the maximum capacity to the method of applying the proper capacity. Therefore, it is desirable to expand port facilities by investigating proper capacity rather than expanding port facilities based on the maximum performance. This study is a case study focusing on the new port of Busan introducing the ACT. From the perspective of national fiscal income and national economy from the ACT investment, this study determines the proper terminal capacity for each berth. As a result of economic analysis, the break-even terminal capacity to secure economic feasibility is from 544,272TEU of the nine berths to 600,138TEU of two berths applying a 2.96% discount ratio. In a sensitivity analysis considering the social discount rate and the change in the size of berths, the net present value has a positive value from a minimum of 530,000 TEU (nine berths with 1.96% social discount ratio) to a maximum of 620,000 TEU (three berths with 3.46% social discount ratio). © 2021 by the authors.

The dominating loads for deep water applications will primarily be caused by current-structure interactions, where vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) are known to be a challenging response type to handle correctly during design. Semi-empirical time-domain models are promising for VIV prediction, but uncertainties related to simplifications in the hydrodynamic load model and empirical parameters lead to over-conservative designs, where the parameters are estimated from model tests within a relatively low Reynolds number range. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient tool to estimate empirical hydrodynamic parameters directly from test data. To illustrate the method, the hydrodynamic parameters were estimated from pure cross-flow VIV model tests in a steady current with Reynolds numbers in the range of 40,000-120,000. The parameters were updated sequentially by using a Bayesian optimization framework, with the aim of minimizing an objective function that incorporates the response errors between time-domain VIV simulations and model test data. It is shown that three empirical parameters can be obtained simultaneously, resulting in small response errors but the optimal parameters were overly sensitive to variations in the flow velocity. The optimal parameters were used to reconstruct the drag amplification related to cross-flow VIV and in forced motion simulations to illustrate how the parameters in the load model would map into the traditional formulation in terms of the added mass and excitation coefficient. © 2023",Bayesian optimization; Digital twins; Drag amplification; Semi-empirical models; Vortex-induced vibrations,Drag; Flow velocity; Fluid structure interaction; Marine risers; Offshore oil well production; Parameter estimation; Reynolds number; Structural design; Time domain analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); Vortex flow; Bayesian optimization; Crossflow vortices; Drag amplification; Empirical parameters; Hydrodynamic parameters; Load modeling; Model tests; Semiempirical models; Time domain models; Vortex induced vibration; Bayesian analysis; cable; computer simulation; design; energy resource; error analysis; flow field; flow velocity; hydrodynamics; loading test; model test; numerical model; offshore engineering; optimization; parameterization; prediction; Reynolds number; riser; vibration; vortex flow; Hydrodynamics,"Aker Solutions ASA; Norges Forskningsråd, (Subsea7); SINTEF Industri",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181770073

Public administrations are willing to contribute to counterpart marine litter but insufficient knowledge hindrance the progress. The integration of economic assessment in the decision-making may help to design knowledge-based solutions that guarantee a good marine litter management within the Blue Economy framework. Nonetheless, there is no clear methodology to do such assessments in the literature. In this study a new approach was implemented by assessing the effectiveness and the efficiency of four solutions designed to remove, monitor and/or manage floating marine litter (FML). In addition, the willingness to pay by local public administrations for purchasing such solutions was assessed. The solutions were tested in the inner waters of the Basque coast (South-Eastern Bay of Biscay), these being: the collection of FML by (1) a litter interception riverine barrier; (2) retrofitted fishing vessels engaged in the active Fishing for Litter; (3) sea-cleaning vessels operated with and without (4) a smart decision-support tool (LEMA Tool). The efficiency was measured by the cost of removing 1 kg of FML and comparing it to other alternative technologies; the effectiveness by a comparison of costs and benefits of removing marine litter for the local fisheries, aquaculture, ports and shipping and tourism sectors; and the willingness to pay was evaluated by Contingent Valuation Method. Results show that the density of FML affects the outcome of the efficiency, effectiveness, and willingness to pay and in return, the density depends on the operating ground and the season of the year among other factors. The most efficient solution is the cleaning vessels (4-7 EUR/kg of FML), followed by the Fishing for Litter fishing vessels (4-75 EUR/kg). LEMA Tool may improve the efficiency of both, fishing vessels and cleaning vessel, but the relative improvement depends on the knowledge of the fishers, the accuracy of the sea surface circulation models and again the local litter density. The barrier proved to be the least efficient solution (103 EUR/kg) and its efficiency depends on the river characteristics. Cleaning vessels are an effective solution, fishing vessel may be effective depending on the operating area among other variables. The willingness to pay of the public administration for purchasing technologies that enable the removal of FML is estimated as 1-8 EUR/kg. These outputs can provide good guidance for decision-makers to overcome the existing problem while prevention measures are implemented and take effect in the environment. Results highlight the possibility of having vessels engaged in the active and the passive Fishing for Litter, when the scopes of each activity are well defined, and overlapping is inexistent.",Marine litter; Externalities; Removal and monitoring; Efficiency and effectiveness; Management; Fishing for Litter,,EU's LIFE Programme (LIFE LEMA project) [LIFE15 ENV/ES/000252],Article,,,,

More recently, Digital Twins have emerged as a promising solution to monitor real-time information and optimize Dry Port operations simultaneously. This paper presents the initial proposal of a reference architecture for developing Dry Port’s Digital Twins. It results from a design science research project conducted in cooperation with a major IT company in the logistics sector and a Dry Port operator in Portugal.

Attention to environment is relevant as well, since these ships are used to operate in spectacular marine ecosystems. The need of European shipyards to continuously progress to preserve the market leadership requires a virtuous evolution of the ship design process projected on a life cycle perspective. In this regard Systems Engineering appears to be a robust and reliable paradigm, able to provide the necessary comprehensive view of the cruise ship system as a whole together with a systematic methodological framework that, among the other advantages, enables the active and constructive participation of all the involved stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, Systems Engineering strongly relies on the so-called model-based engineering to share, integrate, combine and improve the level of details relevant to the system under development.

In turn, during the last two years, we have observed that the increase of consumer goods has resulted in global shipping deadlocks. In addition, the future goes through the role of ports and efficiency in maritime transport to decarbonize its impact on the environment. In order to improve the economy and people's lives, in this work, we propose to enhance services offered in maritime logistics. To do this, a communications system is designed on the deck of ships to transmit data through a constellation of satellites using interconnected smart devices based on IoT. Among the services, we highlight the monitoring and tracking of refrigerated containers, the transmission of geolocation data from Global Positioning System (GPS), and security through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This information will be used for a fleet of ships to make better decisions and help guarantee the status of the cargo and maritime safety on the routes.

The objective of the Glen Lyon Digital Twin has always been to monitor and inform structural barrier health and verify operation within the allowable design limits. A detailed vessel motion response and loads monitoring is being undertaken to keep track of the fatigue life consumption of the hull structure, and to take mitigating actions as needed to maintain integrity. The structural response monitoring system onboard is contained within the vessel's Integrated Marine Monitoring System (IMMS), which consists of various sensors, including accelerometers and strain gauges. The measurements from these are accessed and post-processed through BMT DEEP, harnessing the benefits of Digital Twin Technology, by bringing in data from all sources and enabling to synthesize and monitor the FPSO response in near real-time from any remote location. The structural dashboard monitors the vessel dynamic stability, relative environment headings, and vessel offsets, through several statistical distribution charts. The hull girder bending moments are continuously monitored through deflections measured by the deck strain gauges. Also, the vessel fatigue damage is computed from the deck strain gauge measurements. Apart from these, the vessel motion responses like relative wave elevations and vertical accelerations at the turret center, are being utilized to help monitor vessel fatigue life consumption by comparison with established fatigue curves using these parameters. Comparisons are made with the predicted fatigue damage rates during the vessel design. Some key insights and findings from these comparisons are presented. The challenges faced in this process are highlighted, along with the steps taken to overcome those.

These solutions can be summarized into either finding other clean, renewable sources or managing the available sources optimally. This research represents smart electrical interconnection management between some of the Egyptian seaports for optimal operation, with a clean sustainable environment as the target. The optimum ports' commitment operation works through certain technical constraints to attain optimal economic and environmental factors. One of the main objectives of this study is the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which is released from the electrical power generation that covers the seaports demands. It is progressed through the green port smart commitment, by incorporating unpolluted and renewable energy resources. This study depends on the redesign of some Egyptian seaports to be green ports with eco-friendly electrical construction. According to the new electrical design, two out of the six studied seaports can be considered as renewable energy generation units consisting of Photovoltaic (PV) electrical generation resources. The new design of the seaports electrical network can be considered as a hybrid network, collecting both fossil fuel electrical power generation and PV sources. To gain benefits from the diversity in geographical behaviors, ports on the red sea and Mediterranean sea are integrated into the network cloud. Connecting ports on red and Mediterranean seas construct a network cloud, which supports the operation of the whole network under different conditions. Hybrid (weighted-discrete) Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (HPSOT) is an effective optimization technique which is applied to provide the optimum interconnection management between the eco-ports. It is developed based on some technical constraints which are the availability of the network buses interconnection, the voltage and frequency levels, and deviations due to the smart unit interconnection and the re-direction of the power flow. The HPSOT is targeted to minimize the economical cost and the harmful environmental impact of the seaport electrical network, while covering the overall network load. The HPSOT is programmed utilizing the Matlab program. It is tested on the six Egyptian seaports network that consists of El Dekheila, Alexandria, and Damietta on the Mediteranean and Port Said, Suez, and Sokhna port on the Suez canal and Red sea. It verifies its accurateness and efficiency in decreasing the combined cost function involving costs of CO2 emission. CO2 emission is reduced to 6% of its previous value for the same consumed electrical energy, that means it has a positive impact on retarding the greenhouse effect and climate change.",Eco-ports smart commitment; environmental sustainability; Egyptian seaports; green ports; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization Technique (HPSOT); optimization techniques; Photovoltaic (PV) power generation; renewable electrical energy resources,UNIT COMMITMENT,,Article,,,,

Seaports are located at the focal point of institutional, industrial, and control activities in a jungle of interconnected information systems. System integration is setting considerable challenges when a group of independent providers are asked to implement complementary software functionalities. For this reason, seaports are the ideal playground where software is highly composite and tailored to a large variety of final users (from the so-called port communities). Although the target would be that of shaping the Port Authorities to be providers of (digital) innovation services, the state-of-the-art is still that of considering them as final users, or proxies of them. For this reason, we show how a canonical cloud, virtualizing a distributed architecture, can be structured to host different, possibly overlapped, tenants, slicing the information system at the infrastructure, platform, and software layers. Resources at the infrastructure and platform layers are shared so that a variety of independent applications can make use of the local calculus and access the data stored in a Data Lake. Such a cloud is adopted by the Port of Livorno as a rapid prototyping framework for the development and deployment of ICT innovation services. In order to demonstrate the versatility of this framework, three case studies relating to as many prototype ICT services (Navigation Safety, e-Freight, and Logistics) released within three industrial tenants are here presented and discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

A “blue planet” whose essential driving force is represented by the ports that ensure the connection also of the most peripheral and insular areas. The activities of ports are configured as an element of economic development and creation of new employment. In Europe, according to the last report of 2020, maritime transport was fundamental to import and export 74% of goods, to generate employment for 1.5 million workers and to move about 420 million passengers. At the same time, port activities are responsible for several negative externalities that are often not considered in business strategies. In recent decades the port industry has undergone a profound transformation because of different technical, commercial, and legal aspects. The smart port concept is based on the ability of new technologies to transform port services into interactive and dynamic businesses, more efficient and transparent. Its objective is to satisfy the needs of customers and users without forgetting its responsibility to the city and the citizens. The digitization combined with careful planning and management of port operations allows us to find smart solutions to optimize logistics and environmental impacts, to promote efficiency and to enhance the safety of both seaports and coastal regions involved.

Studies on the prevalence and hazardous effects on marine creatures have been conducted all over the world, but only in coastal environments. Microplastic pollution has emerged as a global concern in marine environments and a danger to animals, predators, and humans because it has been discovered in the marine environment all over the world. This review examines the quantity of MP samples around the world and their colonization by marine microorganisms, as well as the detection, features, origins, and ecological implications of paint fragments and resins in our oceans and ports. These polymers are derived from paints and the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) matrix used in shipbuilding. Microplastics should be regarded as coming from synthetic polymers found in ship coatings. For assessing microplastic pollution, choosing an appropriate sample technique is essential. Additionally, this review offers an overview of MP investigation methods, concentrating on sampling techniques, laboratory procedures, and the identification of MPs found in seawater, as well as assessing how well they apply to the seaport environment. Because of the widespread discovery of MP pollution, particularly in Africa, Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and Europe, it is clear that monitoring is crucial for determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts to limit the quantity of waste plastic entering the environment, especially through sensors and real-time information transfer systems (e.g., smart digital seawater monitoring).",microplastics; marine debris; marine pollution; port environment; monitoring; meta-analysis,MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; PLASTIC DEBRIS; SURFACE WATERS; FRESH-WATER; SEA; BAY; SEDIMENTS; PARTICLES; ORGANISMS; INGESTION,,Review,,,,

As such, their efficency is key to ensure sustainable supply chains across the world. Current studies point interoperability and data integration as the next milestones to achieve efficient, smart ports. DataPorts aims at covering those gaps, delivering an industrial data platform bearing in mind seaports’ involved actors’ needs. With DataPorts, transportation and logistics companies will leverage the current data deluge to offer cognitive services. This paper describes the technical design of such a platform and how it enables the acquisition, homogenization, and processing of the heterogeneous data, judiciously handled to generate advanced data-exhaustive services.

A systematic categorization of vessel components has been conducted, complemented by an analysis of key services delivered within ports. The vulnerabilities of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) have been given particular consideration since it is a critical subcategory of many maritime infrastructures and, consequently, a target for cyber attacks. Recent research confirms that the dramatic proliferation of cyber crimes is fueled by increased levels of integration of new enabling technologies, such as IoT and Big Data. The trend to greater systems integration is, however, compelling, yielding significant business value by facilitating the operation of autonomous vessels, greater exploitation of smart ports, a reduction in the level of manpower and a marked improvement in fuel consumption and efficiency of services.

New concepts for training application of these innovative technologies have been developed at Maritime Simulation Centre Warnemunde MSCW / ISSIMS Institute in research projects. The innovation is to simulate the ships motion with complex dynamic models in fast time and to display the ships track immediately for the intended or actual rudder or engine manoeuvre, steered by a smart interface. These simulations allow for new type of manoeuvring design and optimisation of not only the next manoeuvring segment ahead but also for the following or even for series of manoeuvring segments. One obvious basic advantage in relation to conventional ship-handling training and navigators' preparation of harbour approaches is the easy creation, visualization and comparability of different manoeuvring strategies. The FTS software system consists of various modules for (a) Manoeuvring Design & Planning, (b) Monitoring & Conning based on Multiple Dynamic Prediction, (c) Trial & Training and (d) Replay and Assessment. Specifically the Planning module is the missing link in Voyage planning because it allows to develop the concept of specifically the manoeuvres in the unsteady motion segment after entering the moles up to the final berthing manoeuvre and even to try out alternatives and limits of environmental effects. For practical application the new FTS-features were interfaced to the new Full-Mission and Desktop ship handling simulator Systems, configured by MarineSoft / benntec, based on Rheinmetall RME bridge simulator software ANS 6000. During recent research activities it became obvious that the new FTS technology has great potential for teaching and learning in the maritime education, both for lecturing and for simulator training in briefing and debriefing sessions of exercises, to make ship handling exercises more efficient and valuable for all parties. Experiences have been made how this new technology can be used to improve the simulator training in the Advanced Ship Handling Training course at the World Maritime University, Malmoe / Sweden [12], at the Maritime Simulation Centre of AIDA Cruises at Rostock /Germany and at the CSMART Centre for Simulator Maritime Training of Carnival Corporation at Almere /NL. In addition to ship handling training, the combination of ANS and FTS can be used in port risk assessments and in harbour and waterway design studies. Samples of application for briefing / debriefing and introduction lectures for simulator exercises specifically for typical cruises ships with Twin-Screw and -Rudder systems will be shown in the paper and at the conference.

The Digital Twin is primarily used as a virtualized representation of the structure, which will be updated according to physical changes during the life cycle of the structure. The methodology is demonstrated on a wind turbine transition piece. A three-dimensional geometry reconstruction of a transition piece as manufactured is created using a large number (>500) of RGB images collected from a drone and/or several LiDAR scans. Comparing the reconstruction to the original design will locate and quantify geometric deviations and production tolerances. An artificial intelligence algorithm is used to detect and classify paint defects/damages from images. The detected and classified paint defects/damages are subsequently digitalized and mapped to the three-dimensional geometric reconstruction of the structure. These developed functionalities allow the Digital Twin of the structure to be updated with manufacturing-induced geometric deviations and paint defects/damages using inspection images at regular time intervals. The key enabling technologies to realize the Digital Twin are presented in this study. The proposed methodology can be used in different industrial sectors, such as the wind energy, oil, and gas industries, aerospace, the marine and transport sector, and other large infrastructures. © 2022 by the authors.

In contrast with the traditional adaptive Kalman filter algorithm, where the fault parameters are treated as extended state variables, the newly proposed adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm estimates the magnitude of the faults by calculating the parameter estimation gains directly from the sensor systems. To this end, the algorithm utilizes data from a global navigation satellite system receiver assuming the persistence of excitation conditions on the control inputs. The algorithm is tested in the Otter, an autonomous surface vehicle developed by Maritime Robotics, in which one of its propellers is faulty. Technically, the digital twin receives real-time data from the sensor system, estimates the magnitude of the actuator faults, and visualizes the results in a web-based application using JavaScript with Three.js library and Mapbox for real-world 3D map generation. Information regarding the magnitude of the faults is important for fault-tolerant control. Simulation and experimental results show the proposed approach is able to detect and estimate the actuator faults accurately.

This is usually accomplished by rotating 20% onshore every year to be dis-assembled and inspected. This requires extensive boat trips from a mobile operating drilling unit (MODU) to onshore and trucking of the riser to the inspection facility. Typically, 20 riser joints from each riser system are transported on a boat and one riser per truck to an inspection facility each year, making the logistics of performing a drilling inspection complex and costly. A laser-based measurement for inspection together with monitoring of riser systems has been implemented with a new standard process for collecting critical riser data that is ABS approved. The aim is to mitigate the costs and time associated with essential MODU drilling riser inspections, by empowering operators to reliably determine the condition of drilling riser joints, consistently predict when vital components will require service and accurately assess remaining component life. The approach utilizes a life cycle condition based monitoring, maintenance and inspection system that can be deployed on a MODU, enabling resources to be deployed only when necessary, instead of on a calendar interval. The solution consists of: Performing a baseline inspection on the riser joints to assess their present state, Collecting the environmental and operating data when the rig is on site drilling, Feeding the environmental and operating data into a digital twin. The tuned digital twin can be used to predict future damage. The approach removes uncertainties surrounding damage of riser joints and will allow the owner to determine whether riser should be redeployed or replaced. This is the only process that is ABS approved for condition based monitoring of drilling riser systems. The system is compatible with all present owners’ maintenance programs and ensures that maintenance requirements are supported with robust engineering.

While this should make management of these assets more effective, the ease in which information can be created often means that we find ourselves unable to find the information we're searching for. As constituent engineering systems become more complex, integrated and autonomous the need to retain documentation that describes operation becomes necessary for efficient maintenance and resolving unforeseen situations. Digital Twin's address this challenge by retaining and publishing documentation, but a key principle is the efficient means to find data to ensure relevance and reduced searching time. For several years, AVEVA has been exploiting the opportunity to link asset documentation together using contextual themes to create a connected dataset which allows quick identification of critical and related information. This has resulted in several Digital Twin interfaces that deploy information into different scenarios and devices, from handheld personal devices to large format screens for team decision support. Using these tools our customers can maintain their vessel, expose trends in data and provide insight into ways their asset may be changing over time. © 2017 The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

Autonomous Marine Vehicles, IoT networks, and humans will coexist in highly heterogeneous multivendor multiplatform environments where market transactions and complex administrative procedures will be ubiquitous. Some blockchains such as the Ethereum network are able to provide distributed scalable computing and trustable functionalities, capable of managing both technical interactions and market transactions among very diversified autonomous agents. For these reasons they seem to provide a valuable backbone for the smart marine infrastructure of the coming decades.

The present paper gives insights on how the installation of LNG tanks inside harbors can be capitalized to increase the energy efficiency of port cities and reduce GHG emissions. To this purpose, a novel integrated energy system is introduced. The Boil Off Gas (BOG) from LNG tanks is exploited in a combined plant, where heat and power are produced by a regenerated gas turbine cycle; at the same time, cold exergy from LNG regasification contributes to an increase in the efficiency of a vapor compression refrigeration cycle. In the paper, the integrated energy system is simulated by means of dynamic modeling under daily variable working conditions. Results confirm that the model is stable and able to determine the time behavior of the integrated plant. Energy saving is evaluated, and daily trends of key thermophysical parameters are reported and discussed. The analysis of thermal recovering from the flue gases shows that it is possible to recover a large energy share from the turbine exhausts. Hence, the system can generate electricity for port cold ironing and, through a secondary brine loop, cold exergy for a refrigeration plant. Overall, the proposed solution allows primary energy savings up to 22% when compared with equivalent standard technologies with the same final user needs. The exploitation of an LNG regasification process through smart integration of energy systems and implementation of efficient energy grids can contribute to greener energy management in harbors.",Liquefied Natural Gas; combined systems; exergy recovery; port; dynamic modeling,EXERGY RECOVERY; COLD; REGASIFICATION; FUEL; OPTIMIZATION; FACILITIES; EMISSIONS; PROSPECTS,European Union's INTERREG IT-FR Maritime Programme [CUP D36C18000260006],Article,,,,

In particular, several technological innovations are changing both the freight and passenger transport sector. The introduction of these technologies in port terminals (smart ports) require involved stakeholders to adapt their asset and organisations in order to improve the economic competitiveness in global markets. The geographical context where new technologies are put in place can also influence their deployment and foreseen impacts. Hence, in order to take the proper decisions at a strategic level and maximize the positive effects in a selected scenario, a feasibility analysis is essential. In the present study, this challenge is addressed for the Adriatic region by proposing a procedure for evaluating and selecting the most promising innovations. Several relevant stakeholders from the selected area are inquired to assess the relevance and deployment difficulties for a set of new technologies dealing with automation in port areas. Then, the impacts on technical operation and labour market are assessed, thus, providing valuable information to support the regional organisations in facing the change and deploying procedures to be potentially replicated in other geographical areas. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Adriatic region; Automation; Smart ports; Strategic decisions,Employment; International trade; Economic competitiveness; Feasibility analysis; Geographical area; Logistics chains; Maritime industry; Passenger transport; Technical operations; Technological innovation; Automation,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092742921

The problem is that especially sizable vessels (i.e., blocking ships) cause severe shadowing for smaller ships (i.e., victim ships) that happen to be behind the blocking ones in a harbour environment, causing a reduced signal strength that would drop the communication link. IRS is employed in this study to mitigate the shadowing problem by relaying the signal from the terrestrial base station to the victim ships in order to bypass the aforementioned blockages. Moreover, IRS elements are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to position the IRS relay dynamically in the air. In this regard, single-and multiple-ship scenarios are considered in order to analyze the impacts of the number of ships and positioning of UAV-IRS relay on the communication performance. Decode-and-forward (DF) relaying is utilized as a benchmark mechanism, and data rate and outage probability metrics are used for the evaluation. The obtained results demonstrate that as the base station transmission power increases, the performance of the IRS relay approaches to the DF relay in terms of outage probability and data rates; for example, a 5% better data rate performance is observed when the base station transmission power is 55 dBm. © 2023 IEEE.",decode and forward; intelligent reflecting surface; Maritime communication; relay; smart port; UAV,Antennas; Base stations; Decoding; Ports and harbors; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Blockings; Data-rate; Decode-and-forward; Intelligent reflecting surface; Maritime communication; Reflecting surface; Relay; Smart port; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Ships,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178264677

Human being has, since the last century, undermined the coastal equilibrium, accentuating or sometimes triggering irreversible erosive phenomena and causing salt wedge intrusion in areas where agricultural production represents a relevant inducement for the local economy. Also critical is the overexploitation of sandy shores, with the consequent alteration of the beach environment, and sometimes the disfigurement of the maritime territory, with the consequent loss of landscape and economic value. In particular, the uncontrolled release of large quantities of plastic material into the environment is increasingly threatening our seas and their marine living organisms.

In the development of processes of innovation and improvement of the sustainability of the activities connected to the port, a strong connection is necessary between all the local stakeholders who, each for the functions of their own competence, can activate improvement processes with common objectives. This paper describes a framework for the activation and coordination of a Locally Integrated Partnership (LIP) towards the development of a multi-term Smart Port Management Strategy (SPMS) to support innovation processes in the sustainable and safe management of the port. The methodology was applied to the case study of the port of Ravenna (Italy) where the state-owned areas managed by Port Authority (public authority managing the port area) are limited to 50 mt-width harbour quay, while the remaining areas are owned by private companies. The result was the development and the implementation of the roadmap for the development of the SPMS of Ravenna Port with a multi-stakeholder participatory approach. This process favoured the activation of many public funds to modernize port infrastructure, as well as private investments for the development and dissemination of innovations and for the sustainable use of port area. This has shown how the development and coordination of a local LIP makes it possible to make synergies between stakeholders more effective in accessing financing funds and sharing development strategies aimed at innovation and sustainability. The framework developed and tested to the case study demonstrated the benefits of a participatory and inclusive process in decision-making processes, with a benefit for all the key aspects of sustainability.

This paper takes the horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) as the research object, studies the applicability of the simulation-based DT real time monitoring method. Firstly, the feasibility of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of HATT is verified by experiments. Secondly, the simulation database is established under various working conditions. Then the DT method is used to reduce the three-dimensional numerical model to a first-order digital model and the simulation result data can be quickly loaded into the digital model for real time data monitoring. If the monitoring data is not calculated in the database, the Kriging interpolation method is used to reconstruct the database for flow field display quickly. For the data with large deviation of comparison result curves, the optimization algorithm is used along with machine learning.

However, the performance of the ACT infrastructure design scheme is subject to the coordination and interaction of the container handling system in different design layouts and dynamic environments. The traditional design method has difficulty in effectively analyzing the above effects in the design process. This work discusses the characteristics of the ACT infrastructure design in the design process framework including preliminary design, detailed design, and scheme evaluation. The benefits of adopting digital twin (DT) in the infrastructure layout design are analyzed in this framework to propose the next-generation design method.

Automatic ship recognition can facilitate the realization of smart ports, and improve the efficiency of port operation and management. In order to take into account the processing efficiency and detection accuracy at the same time, the study presented an improved deep-learning network based on You only look once version 3 (Yolov3) for all-day ship detection with visible and infrared images. Yolov3 network can simultaneously improve the recognition ability of large and small objects through multiscale feature-extraction architecture. Considering reducing computational time and network complexity with relatively competitive detection accuracy, the study modified the architecture of Yolov3 by choosing an appropriate input image size, fewer convolution filters, and detection scales. In addition, the reduced Yolov3 was further modified with the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module to improve the network performance in feature extraction. Therefore, the proposed modified network can achieve the purpose of multi-scale, multi-type, and multi-resolution ship detection. In the study, a common self-built data set was introduced, aiming to conduct all-day and real-time ship detection. The data set included a total of 5557 infrared and visible light images from six common ship types in northern Taiwan ports. The experimental results on the data set showed that the proposed modified network architecture achieved acceptable performance in ship detection, with the mean average precision (mAP) of 93.2%, processing 104 frames per second (FPS), and 29.2 billion floating point operations (BFLOPs). Compared with the original Yolov3, the proposed method can increase mAP and FPS by about 5.8% and 8%, respectively, while reducing BFLOPs by about 47.5%. Furthermore, the computational efficiency and detection performance of the proposed approach have been verified in the comparative experiments with some existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In conclusion, the proposed method can achieve high detection accuracy with lower computational costs compared to other networks. © 2022 by the authors.

This configuration forms twin-object images that are recorded in a digital hologram by angular and polarization multiplexing technique. We show that the separation of the two images on the recording plane follows a linear relationship with the defocus distance and indicates the defocus direction. Thus, in the entire field of view (FOV), the best focus distance of each object can be directly retrieved by identifying the respective separation distance with a cross-cor relation algorithm, at the same time, 3D tracking can be performed by calculating the transverse coordinates of the two images. Moreover, we estimate this linear relationship by utilizing the numerical propagation calculation based on a single hologram, in which the focus distance of one of the objects in the FOV is known. We proved the proposed approach in accurate 3D tracking through multiple completely different experimental cases, i.e., recovering the swimming path of a marine alga (tetraselmis) in water and fast refocusing of ovarian cancer cells under micro-vibration stimulation. The reported experimental results validate the proposed strategy's effectiveness in dynamic measurement and 3D tracking without multiple diffraction calculations and any precise knowledge about the setup. We claim that it is the first time that a holographic polarization multiplexing setup is exploited intrinsically for 3D tracking and/or fast and accurate refocusing. This means that almost any polarization DH setup, thanks to our results, can guarantee accurate focusing along the optical axis in addition to polarization analysis of the sample, thus overcoming the limitation of the poor axial resolution.

The use of these models is of particular interest for an Infrastructure Manager such as the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF, owner and operator of the railways in France) where they can be used to simulate different operational and maintenance scenarios required to ensure the security and accessibility of the railway network. Flood events cause significant disruption to the French railway network each year and digital twin models present an opportunity to better understand the relationship between the railway infrastructure and the natural environment. The use of digital twins requires the collection and interpretation of data from different sources, the level of detail (LOD) required in the model being determined by the final users of the data. Ideally the digital twin is constructed during the design stage, which is subsequently updated during the construction phase before being passed on to the Infrastructure Manager for exploitation during the maintenance period. For the SNCF, one of the principal challenges for the construction of a digital twin is in the collation of data of sufficient quality which is particularly difficult when considering that the railway network was predominantly constructed in the mid to late 19th century and design information has been archived or lost. Once the digital twin has been constructed, the objective for the Infrastructure Manager is to integrate, analyze and ultimately eliminate structural damage identified on the network during periodic visits. Combining dynamic surveillance data with knowledge of infrastructure construction information allows engineers and decision makers at the SNCF to efficiently manage their assets. This article will present the findings of a digital twin trial project undertaken on a maritime flood defense structure which protects both a section of railway line and several communities on the west coast of France. The aim of the project is to identify the level of detail necessary to have a fully functional digitalized numerical model whilst limiting the resources needed to construct and maintain the digital twin. Integration of flood event information into the model (flood levels, sources and types of flooding, simulations, etc.) will improve the understanding of these natural hazards at the SNCF, improve its communication within the organization and should ultimately lead to greater efficiency in the goal of reducing flood risk on the French railway network. © 2023 IAHR - International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.",Digital Twin; Flood Risk; Infrastructure Manager; Railway; Resilience; SNCF,,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187685393

Occasionally, the actual environmental loads are much larger than design values, resulting in deviations from design conditions that may cause serious structural damage. A structural digital twin can enhance predictability and reliability of marine structures, and thus provide vessel operators, owners, and stakeholders with a more accurate overview of a vessel's condition. It can also help reduce lifecycle costs through proposing rational and optimal inspection, maintenance, repair programs, and assist on maximizing service life and mission availability. This paper uses a benchmark vessel to investigate structural behaviors of the vessel through dynamic loading approach. The correlation between structure members and critical responses are established, and high stress concentration areas have been identified. Subsequently, this paper develops a conceptual digital twin architecture. The proposed digital twin predicts responses of the entire structure to measured or predicted environmental conditions with a hybrid model combining numerical simulations with measurements. While the traditional structural monitoring system focuses on the health condition of typical hot spots, the proposed digital twin may improve structural health awareness of the entire hull structure based on a limited number of sensors.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",critical responses; digital twin; dynamic loading approach; ship structural health management,Dynamic loads; Memory architecture; Offshore structures; Repair; Shipbuilding; Structural health monitoring; Concept designs; Condition; Critical response; Design value; Dynamic loading approaches; Environmental loads; Ocean going vessels; Severe weather; Ship structural health management; Structural health managements; Ships,"National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Singapore Maritime Institute, SMI, (SMI-2019-MTP-01)",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137113798

So, there is a growing need for a design of a location-based smart port terminal. In port terminals, especially, valuable time can be saved by recognizing precisely where the nearest available containers or mobile equipment can be found. A real time locating system (RTLS) is a novel technology which estimates and tracks mobile objects and personal. However, RTLSs in port terminals are likely to include a large of uncertainty, and could not find the location of assets because they can be easily damaged by malicious materials such as steel and water. This paper proposes an enhanced trajectory estimation method for the RTLS in port logistics environment. Basically, the RTLS for the port terminal estimates the location of mobile equipment which includes a large of packet loss and uncertainties. The proposed method corrects inaccurate location information and mitigates uncertainties occurred by the RTLS by adopting interpolation and the Kalman filter.

In particular, the vertical heave motion is undesired for safe transferring, accurate positioning and subsea installation. In recent years, there have been growing tasks in utilizing ship motion data for online operation improvement based on the development of virtual simulation environment, digital twin and automatic remote-control systems. How to effectively utilize ship motion data is fundamental to these tasks. This paper presents a neural-network-based method to predict ship motion and use the prediction to improve active heave compensation (AHC) of offshore crane operation. A virtual prototype of the lifting system is developed including implementation of the proposed AHC algorithms. A multilayer perceptron model is trained to predict ship motion. By feeding the future motion of the ship into the controller, the lifting performance can be tested in the virtual environment and the result can be applied to its counterpart. Through simulation with measured sensor data, the proposed method is verified efficient in improving crane operation performance. © 2020 IEEE.",active heave compensation; hybrid simulation; neural network,Cranes; Digital twin; Forecasting; Industrial electronics; Multilayer neural networks; Offshore oil well production; Online systems; Remote control; Ships; Simulation platform; Active heave compensations; Automatic remote control; Crane operations; Heave motion; Lifting systems; Online operations; Subsea installations; Virtual simulation environments; Motion estimation,"EU H2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (826452); Norges Forskningsråd, (280703)",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097554276

However, the need of protecting the local coasts and reducing CO2 emission is making WR attractive even for the market of leisure boats, especially if comfort and safety are also accounted. In the present study, a prototype of a WR system is presented. The developed tool implements the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fuel-optimal path while ensuring comfort and safety. A computationally efficient digital twin of a planing boat, based on a 2D+t model and a powertrain mapped model, has been implemented for the estimation of the fuel consumption and the evaluation of vertical accelerations. The methodology for the acquisition of online weather data is presented, together with the strategy for the assessment of comfort and habitability. The application of the WR tool in a typical path of the Tuscan Archipelago shows improvements in fuel usage and comfort even in moderate weather conditions. The influence of each weather variable on fuel efficiency is assessed, highlighting the requirement of an accurate dynamic modelling. Criteria for the graph design are also outlined, showing a wrong estimation of comfort and fuel usage in case of low-definition graphs. The paper proves the potential and the effectiveness of the developed tool, moving toward a greener and more comfortable navigation in local seas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Leisure; Meteorology; CO2 emissions; Computationally efficient; Dijkstra's algorithms; Fuel optimal; Leisure boats; Maritime transport; Optimal paths; Routings; Shipping companies; Weather routing system; Boats,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146497085

Furthermore, a significant effort is being made towards a green energy transition at seaports, which can be supported through marine renewable sources. This promotes energy-mix diversification and autonomy, whilst reducing the noteworthy environmental footprint of seaport activities.

The use of those models would allow to improve the engine cost-efficiency trade-off, operational robustness, and environmental impact. To address this challenge, two state-of-the-art alternatives in literature exist. The first one is to develop high fidelity physical models (e.g., mean value engine, zero-dimensional, and one-dimensional models) exploiting the physical principles that regulate engine behaviour. The second one is to exploit historical data produced by the modern engine control and automation systems or by high-fidelity simulators to feed data-driven models (e.g., shallow and deep machine learning models) able to learn an accurate digital twin of the system without any prior knowledge. The main issues of the former approach are its complexity and the high (in some case prohibitive) computational requirements. While the main issues of the latter approach are the unpredictability of their behaviour (guarantees can be proved only for their average behaviour) and the need for large amount of historical data. In this work, following a recent promising line of research, we describe a modelling framework that is able to hybridise physical and data driven models, delivering a solution able to take the best of the two approaches, resulting in accurate, reliable, and computationally inexpensive models. In particular, we will focus on modelling the dynamic state of a four-stroke diesel engine testing the performance (both in terms of accuracy, reliability, and computational requirements) of this solution against state-of-the-art physical modelling approaches on real-world operational data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Data-driven models; Hybridisation; Marine diesel engine; Physical models,,Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding,Book chapter,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122467153

As a consequence, a crucial issue for the maritime industry is to develop technologies able to increase the ship efficiency, by reducing fuel consumption and unnecessary maintenance operations. For example, the marine fouling phenomenon has a deep impact, since to prevent or reduce its growth which affects the ship consumption, costly drydockings for cleaning the hull and the propeller are needed and must be scheduled based on a speed loss estimation. In this work a data driven Digital Twin of the ship is built, leveraging on the large amount of information collected from the on-board sensors, and is used for estimating the speed loss due to marine fouling. A thorough comparison between the proposed method and ISO 19030, which is the de-facto standard for dealing with this task, is carried out on real-world data coming from two Handymax chemical/product tankers.

Dual fuel engines, running on both gaseous and liquid fuels, represent a viable way toward the reduction of emissions at the cost of additional complexity in monitoring activities. Motivation: Data-driven methods represent the frontier in research and in maritime industrial applications, and they usually require a large amount of labelled data, i.e., sensor measurements plus the associated engine status usually annotated by human operators, which are costly and seldomly available in the wild. Unlabelled samples, instead, are commonly, cheaply, and readily available. Hypothesis: The enabling technology for data-driven methods is the availability of a network of sensors and an automation system able to capture and store the associated stream of data. Methods: In this paper, we design and propose multiple alternatives toward the weakly supervised marine dual fuel engines data-driven monitoring. To this aim, we will rely on a Digital Twin of the dual fuel engine or on novelty detection algorithms and we will compare them against state-of-the-art fully supervised approaches. Results: Results on data generated from a real-data validated simulator of a marine dual fuel engine demonstrate that the proposed weakly supervised monitoring approaches lead to a negligible loss in accuracy compared to costly and often unfeasible fully supervised ones supporting the validity of the proposal for its application in the wild. Conclusion: The main outcome is a guideline for selecting the best data-driven dual fuel engine monitoring method according to the available data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Digital Twin; Dual fuel engine; Fully supervised; Maritime transport; Monitoring; Weakly supervised,Automation; Data Analytics; Data streams; Digital twin; Fuels; Industrial research; Marine engines; Waterway transportation; Data-driven methods; Enabling technologies; Environmental footprints; Maritime transportation; Monitoring activities; Monitoring approach; Reduction of emissions; Sensor measurements; Dual fuel engines,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101171663

Taking advantage of such information, this work presents a retroanalysis procedure that updates and calibrates numerical models to represent the updated as-laid configuration of the FPS. This procedure has been implemented in association with the in-house, non-commercial SITUA-Prosim software that employs uncoupled, fully coupled and hybrid analysis formulations. The steps of the procedure are automated within the software. The application of the procedure is illustrated in a case study considering a typical FPS representative of actual offshore scenarios. This retroanalysis procedure may be seen as the first stage for the development of a digital twin for FPS, and for the establishment of an integrity assessment methodology using the updated as-laid models.

However, modern digital technologies had not pervaded before in the sector because of, mainly, ports’ complexity and heterogeneity as wide ecosystems. When it comes to applying innovative digital tools in maritime ports, a series of additional common barriers are usually faced: (i) unavailability of clear reference in open-source based technologies, (ii) closed-environments and high pricing rates of private providers, (iii) restricting regulations inside and outside the ports preventing port authorities to deploy useful products and (iv) high heterogeneity of objectives, data or perspectives to carry out focused accountable actions. The PIXEL project has helped ports of all sizes to overcome those barriers during the last three years. Throughout a variety of domains of action – including clean energy, environmental performance, smart intermodal transport or machine learning-based maritime data analytics, PIXEL has addressed those hindrances, driving four European ports towards the Port of The Future stand. The different open applications developed form an ecosystem that may be adopted by external ports aiming at improving their digitalisation levels and their operational and environmental performance. For the 2021 edition, we are presenting the suite of tools deployed in the ports in the context of the action, their success stories and best practices, and how they can be leveraged by worldwide maritime transport entities in the future. It is our objective to provide a comprehensive review of their functioning, technical traits and particularities and how they are planned to be exploited by the Consortium.

Most of the geo-hazards occur in oceanic areas. Thus, high-quality systematic observations are necessary tools for improving our understanding, and subsequent assimilation to provide early warning systems. A holistic scientific approach for the understanding of the ocean’s interrelated processes requires coordinated and complementary monitoring and observation programmes. Research Infrastructures (RIs) are large-scale facilities that provide resources and services for the scientific communities to conduct high-level research and foster innovation. RIs benefit from strong governance and multi-annual funding from their member states with operational life spans in decades. RIs promote knowledge, outreach and education to public, private, and policy stakeholders, and they play a key role in enabling and developing research in all scientific domains and currently represent a growing share of coordinated investment in research, and also in providing essential observations to operational services such as Copernicus. They are strategically important for Europe to lead a global movement towards a data-driven, interconnected, open digital twin that brings together different disciplines, clean technologies, public and private sectors and a broad scientific/technological community, as well as education and training. In Europe several marine RIs have been established, which are maintained by national and European Union (EU) resources. The aims of these infrastructures are aligned with the key priorities of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development; and with the new European Research Area (ERA) Policy Agenda annexed to the Council conclusions on the ERA governance1, which set out 20 concrete actions for 2022-2024 to contribute to the priority areas defined in the EU Pact for R&I2. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the combined expertise and assets of Europe’s marine RIs can form a comprehensive and holistic framework for long-term, sustainable integrated marine observation. Through this integration process the marine RIs can become better and better a significant pillar of the European Ocean Observing System (EOOS). Such a framework must be built as part of interfaces of interaction and promote not only scientific excellence but also innovation at all levels.

During design, users might opt to visualize the model of the ship with a spatial view; during operation, they can resort to a detailed visualization displaying the vessel as built. Three examples are provided to illustrate the potential of these features. First, a dashboard displaying results for hydrostatics, stability, resistance, and motion response. The second use case hypothesizes a vessel is set to undergo a jumboization procedure and compares the analyses results for the vessel after elongation with the current ones. The third exemplifies how a preliminary maneuvering model can be confronted with results from a sea trial by linking the app to operational data, a step towards digital-Twin concepts.

Refrigeration is also key to enable successful transcontinental export to distant markets. To minimize the environmental impact of the cold chain and to optimize logistics, a better knowledge of the fruit quality evolution within individual shipments would be extremely valueable. For this purpose, a digital fruit twin is developed, based on mechanistic modeling. This digital twin simulates the thermal behavior of mango fruit throughout the cold chain, based on the measured environmental temperature conditions, namely the air temperature in the vicinity of the fruit. At the same time, the evolution of associated quality attributes, due to enzymatically-driven, temperature-dependent biochemical degradation reactions, is quantified. Also, a biophysical counterpart of real mango fruit – an innovative fruit simulator sensing device – was developed and used for model validation of fruit pulp temperatures. We identified – in-silico – the impact of the unique delivery air temperature history and cold chain length on fruit quality evolution for actual maritime vs. airfreight transport pathways. Digital twins were found to provide complementary insights in the thermophysical behavior of fruit, particularly in supply chains of very perishable species, and for storage at low airflow rates. Such mechanistic modeling enabled to understand, record, and predict where temperature-dependent fruit quality loss occurs in each supply chain. In that way, digital twins can help to improve refrigeration processes and logistics to reduce food losses, thereby making the refrigerated supply chain greener. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Biophysical twin; Digital avatar; Fruit simulator; In-silico; Multiphysics; Thermophysical,Atmospheric temperature; Biodegradation; Energy dissipation; Environmental impact; Food storage; Quality management; Refrigeration; Supply chains; Thermal processing (foods); Biophysical twin; Digital avatar; In-silico; Multi-physics; Thermophysical; air temperature; biochemistry; cooling; fruit; modeling; simulator; supply chain management; air temperature; Article; biochemical analysis; catering service; computer model; cooling; degradation; digital twins probe; environmental impact; environmental temperature; evolution; food; food quality; fruit pulp; mango; nonhuman; prediction; quantitative analysis; refrigeration; storage; Fruits,"Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF, (200021 _ 169372); Kommission für Technologie und Innovation, CTI, (18155.2 PFLS-LS, 26032.1 PFLS-LS)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070210024

The correlation between dependend and independent data set variables is presented in order to map the engine behaviour and validate the DT model before becoming operational. The analyses are conducted using the engine in gas mode, operating at 85% of Load (at the nominal speed of 600rpm). This operating point represents the typical target design for constant speed applications. The engine efficiency, emissions and combustion chamber parameters are investigated by varying the air-fuel mixture pressure, timing and duration parameters. Sensitivity analysis presents a tight relation between Nitrogen Oxides and Hydrocarbons (HC) emissions by varying the Scavenging Air Pressure. The HC emission function around the nominal value of the Pilot Fuel Injection Duration reverse its trend, while In Cylinder-Pressure and Combustion Duration functions presents opposite gradients.

The frenetic effort made by shipping companies to decarbonize maritime transport must be followed by an unstoppable adaptation of ports from the historical supply of only fuel and diesel to covering the demands of new fuels, ensuring their renewable origin; onshore power supply (OPS); or even the storage of captured CO2. This article compiles the current environmental regulations applied to maritime transport to provide an analysis of the current situation and a link between vessels’ requirements to comply with such regulations and port environmental infrastructure. This work demonstrates that technological development is growing faster onboard vessels than at ports. It is demonstrated that except for the case of LNG, the theoretical shipping fuel world demand of each type of alternative fuel cannot be absorbed by current world production, where we found big gaps between supply and demand of up to 96.9%. This work concludes that to speed up this process, ports will need European aid as well as private investment. It is proposed that for the next steps, the port system needs to provide the required infrastructure to vessels on time, which inevitably means improvements in competitiveness and governance to promote the blue economy and the concept of smart ports, attracting main international shipping lines with a complete decarbonization hub on their routes by taking advantage of the geostrategic role of the Iberian ports. At the same time, the port governance model must be more flexible in the decision-making process, anticipating changes in maritime regulations with the challenge of coordinating public and private interests, serving as a link, once again, between ship and society. © 2024 by the authors.",alternative fuels; decarbonization; IMO; LNG; maritime transport; port; Portugal; scrubber; Spain,Portugal; Spain; alternative energy; international aid; liquefied petroleum gas; port operation; shipping; standard (regulation); technological development; vessel traffic management system,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183399633

Ships have been operating at reduced speeds in recent years and, the liner temperatures of marine diesel engines vary significantly at reduced loads, which increase the heat loss from main engine. The research focuses on revealing the energy efficiency enhancement potential by decreasing heat loss through jacket water during reduced loads without any permanent modification. The heat loss reduction is achieved by means of higher coolant (glycol–water mixture) temperatures, to keep the liner temperatures at their maximum permissible temperatures. The methodology is calculating the energy balance and efficiency increment at reduced loads of main engine by modelling. The model have been validated with the digital twin of a two-stroke Sulzer-12RTA84C marine diesel engine. The simulated results comprise in-cylinder pressures, exhaust gas temperature and pressure, scavenge pressure, engine speed, turbo-charger, indicated power and heat transfer rate. Liner temperatures, affecting the heat transfer rate, are investigated in variable operating loads of the main engine. The study shows that keeping the liner temperature of the engine at the maximum continuous rating's temperature, has respectable efficiency advantages under different operating loads. 0.5% reduction in fuel consumption could be achieved, coming with 127.8 tons fuel and 398 tons CO2 reduction in a year. Additionally, waste heat recovery system calculations were carried out and additional 48.8 tons of fuel could be saved in the generation of electricity. In total 176.6 tons of fuel and 550 tons of CO2 emission reduction could be achieved. As a result, the controlled cylinder wall temperatures can be considered as one of the methods to solve the efficiency and emission problems in ships in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cylinder liner temperature; Energy efficiency; Engine cooling; Low heat rejection; Marine diesel engine model; Thermal energy management,Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Digital twin; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Fuels; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Marine engines; Ships; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; CO2 emission reduction; Cylinder wall temperature; Efficiency enhancement; Exhaust gas temperatures; International regulations; Maximum continuous ratings; Operational techniques; Waste heat recovery systems; Energy efficiency,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086433859

Specifically, there is a lack of understanding regarding the infiltration and transport dynamics of MP across the streambed interface and within the hyporheic sediments. In this study, transport and retention of MP are investigated using a new numerical modeling approach. The model is built as a digital twin of accompanying flume experiments, which are used to validate the simulation results. The model accurately represents particle transport in turbulent water flow and within the hyporheic zone (HZ). Simulations for transport and infiltration of 1 µm MP particles into a sandy streambed demonstrate that the advection-dispersion equation can be used to adequately represent particle transport for pore-scale sized MP within the HZ. To assess the applicability of the modeling framework for larger MP, the experiment was repeated using 10 µm particles. The larger particles exhibited delayed infiltration and transport behavior, and while the model successfully represented the spatial extent of particle transport through the HZ, it was unable to fully replicate hyporheic transit times. This study is the first to combine explicit validation against experimental data, encompassing qualitative observations of MP concentration patterns and quantification of fluxes.

Performance improvement has become a difficult task, as new decision-making tools are required to manage the increasing complexity of technologies and systems. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a holistic approach capable to analyze the integrated performance of complex systems by shifting the focus from the isolated components to the integral system and its behavior. MBSE utilizes advanced computer-aided modeling and simulation methods and tools, to develop ""digital twins"" of technology components and to test their combined performance in integrated systems. Such methods are widely used in industries like aeronautics, electronics, chemical/processing, and space exploration and have been recently introduced in shipping.

Development efforts have mainly focused on detecting mooring failures which result in changes in the behaviour of the floating structure within a short time scale. However, these monitoring system technologies can also be leveraged to detect degradation in mooring system performance over longer time scales. The stiffness of a mooring system can be influenced by several factors including creep of synthetic rope, damage to rope construction, interlink wear of mooring chain, seabed trenching of mooring lines, excessive marine growth and loss of clump weights on mooring lines. Such changes in stiffness can change the dynamic response of the floating structure, potentially increasing the offset in extreme sea states beyond the allowable design offset limits. Hardware that measures mooring line loads or departure angles as a direct means of monitoring for mooring line failures can also be used to detect changes in mooring line pre-tension and therefore monitor for long-term changes in mooring stiffness. However, such hardware (load cells, inclinometers, sonar systems, strain gauging, etc.) can be expensive to retrofit, costly to maintain and suffer from long-term reliability issues. This has led to the implementation of solutions using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) vessel position data as a more cost-effective and reliable alternative for real-time mooring integrity monitoring. There are multiple methods by which a GNSS-based integrity monitoring system can be programmed to detect mooring failures, most commonly by employing machine learning models. This paper presents a method to extend a machine learning model used for a GNSSbased integrity monitoring system to also monitor for changes in mooring system stiffness, by leveraging the use of a digital twin and assessing long-term changes in measured excursions. This method will be demonstrated via a case study for a spreadmoored floating facility.

The following summary and recommendations are made for future work in the area of innovative experimental methods in ships and offshore industry. It is important to also note that as experimental techniques allow for a greater understanding of the underlying material and structural behaviour, and generate extensive data clouds for processing and evaluation. As a result, we recommend that a future chapter in the next committee report focus on data evaluation and statistical approaches; this can provide an in-depth look of state of the art of processes utilized for evaluating the extensive data captured/utilized during experiments. In chapter 2, a review of scaling laws is presented in systematic and recent advancements in structural testing related to ships and offshore structures. General scale modelling methods are provided and described the main characteristics of each method such as dimensional analysis, applied to governing equation, energy method, empirical similarity method through the literature review. Recent application of scale models can be found in field of offshore wind turbine structure and ice testing area. These structures are subjected to complex phenomena such as wave loads and drifting forces may also need to be considered in particular applications, ice flows, continuous winter sea ice, and icebergs. Application DIC in chapter 3, DIC techniques have certainly come into play in many recent experimental evaluations, as the methods allows for elucidating the surface strain behaviour of a component evaluated either in the laboratory and in the field. This chapter has been to give an updated review on applications of DIC techniques in ships and offshore structural tests classifying them by test articles, with a brief insight on commercial instrumentations available on the industry and related to DIC society and a deeper focus on the applied methodologies, providing recent references for those who are interested in this topic. Worth mentioning is that some DIC applications are included in the benchmark study performed by the Committee and reported in section 15. In chapter 4, A large amount of research has focused on better measuring and predicting the hydrodynamic loads, forming several practical hydrodynamic coefficients databases which have been widely used in VIV prediction tools for flexible structure manufacturing industry. Although these databases make great contributions to the field of VIV research, have not been sufficiently modelled in the coefficient database obtained from rigid cylinder experiments. Recently, the phase angle between cross-flow and in-line response had a strong influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients for both rigid and flexible cylinders. And variations of tension and flow velocity were strongly correlated with time-varying hydrodynamic coefficients, therefore, inputs to the prediction of vessel motion induced VIVs, making the prediction possible. Also, the effects of Re numbers and surface roughness on hydrodynamics of VIV and the effect of wake interference on hydrodynamics of a twin-tube submerged floating tunnel (SFT) can be found for can efficient way and requirement in the literature. In chapter 5, based on the challenges remaining in the problem of wave-in-deck impact on offshore structures discussed above, there are several research gaps that can be addressed in future. There is still considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of wave impact loads on structural deck elements near the free-surface. Effects of the columns of the floating platform on the wave-in-deck forces have not been systematically studied. The measurement, estimation and simulation of local pressures due to wave-in-deck impact events on all types of offshore structures remains challenging. Accurate measurements and prediction of global loads and dynamic response of floating offshore structures due to wave-in-deck impact events is extremely limited. Combined numerical-experimental wave-in-deck investigations on floating offshore structures are not currently available in the open literature. In chapter 6, this chapter focused on hybrid model testing (HMT) combines physical model test and numerical simulations to solve problems that physical model tests alone cannot conveniently or reliably address. In marine model testing, the challenges like ultra-deep water, multi-phase fluids, parameter traversal and so on cannot be avoided. HMT is regarded as the most promising technique to solve these issues. As of today, HMT is still immature, some advanced applications however have been developed. HMT allows researchers to impose mass-spring-damping parameters in virtual space and can artificially adjust and precisely control these critical parameters. It is a very helpful and exciting idea to solve the involved problems. In Chapter 7, a brief reviewed of friction test in terms of two main areas exist where friction is of importance: machineries and mechanical connections, and in cargo/mechanical handling operations. For maritime and offshore applications (e.g. Out-of-Plane Bending), surface conditions and environmental conditions are important parameters. Small and the smaller specimens may be used for screening the theoretical friction coefficients and find trends. Larger or even real size specimens should be used to confirm the actual behaviour. As per the results of literature, friction tests can be split it eh standard, small size specimen standard tests, and the large size, more representative tests. While the standard tests are well covered by standards and guidelines, the larger set-ups are to be tailor made and require goo understanding of the physics as results require interpretation by the experimenter. In chapter 8, the measurement, analysis and mitigation of vibrations in ship and offshore structures is rather well established. Nevertheless, measurement and mitigation methods are still being developed. Measurement’s techniques may also include laser of video techniques. Mitigation measures include devices that cancel vibrations at a low weight penalty, such as absorbing supports or Tuned Mass Dampers. Numerical developments include methods that use sub-structuring or modal shapes to reduce the computational cost. In chapter 9, Material selection for ships and offshore structures exposed to sub-zero temperatures is traditionally based on Charpy and fracture toughness test results of the base materials and its welded connections. In the last years however, fatigue properties have been the focus of a couple of studies due to the acceleration of fatigue crack growth below the so-called fatigue transition temperature, where ductile crack growth is superimposed by cleavage burst. Concluding, fatigue testing at low temperatures demands special attention to the set-up and instrumentation. The testing temperature is normally lower than the application temperature, and liquid nitrogen may be needed to cool down the area of interest to -60 °C. Temperature compensation is required for sensor, either strain gauges or potential drop methods. In chapter 10, The corrosion process and the interpretation of the effect of corrosion on the structural integrity remains an area of uncertainty. In corrosion testing, a large spread may be observed in measured corrosion rates, as is confirmed by industrial thickness measurement. Including the geometrical effects of corrosion damage in a representative manner in numerical simulations requires the use of probabilistic methods, as a precise description would require model with too many details. Hence, simplifications and generalizations are needed. In chapter 11, large scale impact experimentation are unique options to verify developments in structures design, analysis and prediction of failure. In turn, this demands good command of the experimentation techniques, and the use of as many sensors as possible to make possible use of the results. In chapter 12, The chapter present a State-of-the-Art review, to include recent advances and future trends of industry challenge with current standard and out lookout. The wind industry is concerning with the long time-to-marked for future large turbine blades and are interested in ways to shorten the test time. It is a question at which size and when will it stop to make sense to test these long blades according to current standard. Trends of development of more advanced test methods investigated a dual or multi axis test methods to test blades under more representative loading compared to operational loads and ways to speed up the test and challenge with different SN-curves for different materials. Testing parts of blades captured testing with more complex and realistic loading at forced loading, challenges with boundaries, and using subcomponent testing to validate numerical models. In chapter 13, Full scale ice load measurements play a significant role in the design of ships and offshore structures in ice covered waters. Full scale measurements of fixed vertical offshore structure are dis-cussed here. Generalizability of the results can be summarised that as pointed out by Kärnä (2009) it is likely that the experimental data recorded on vertical structures is only applicable for the conditions where the data was record-ed. Thus, data recorded for stiff structures might not be applicable for compliant structures. As discussed before, the compliancy might be one source of the observed rate dependency. The collected data is often incomplete: although local and global ice forces can be recorded during ice action, the ice properties (compressive strength, porosity...) might remain unknown. It is because the ice samples cannot be taken during ice action - when ice is moving. Actual local pressure is challenging to measure. It is known that the ice pressure is concentrated in a small area as shown by Joensuu & Riska (1989). They observed in laboratory scale experiments using PVDF-film that the ice pressure is concentrated on narrow, line like high pressure zones. But, the area of the load panels in full scale of often quite big, in the order of 1 m2. Thus, the actual local pressure exerted to structure is significantly higher than the average pressure measured with the big load panels. But there is no method available for more accurate local pressure measurements in full scale. Although field tests are important and can reveal phenomena that cannot be observed in laboratory scale, there are few things to consider when interpreting the results. In chapter 14, Bridging the relationship between the degradation in the material and the structure is an emerging field of research which requires advanced data fusion, signal processing, AI-based trend detection algorithms and the reliability analysis methods. Data fusion herein refers to combining the data gathered from different SHM sensors by using data fusion algorithms for better damage diagnosis (Eleftheroglou et al., 2018). Other research efforts are recommended for improving the durability of SHM sensors for offshore implementations, inclusion of SHM in the condition monitoring standards and guidelines, addressing big-data issues for developing real-time data collection and analysis frameworks and using the digital twins for real-time reliability assessment. In the Benchmark study, from this relatively simple experiment performed by 6 parties, it is clear that a vast range of choices can be made to carry out the tests. Understanding the effect of the choices on the end result is essential. For instance, a heavy sensor influences the natural frequency a lot. Also, the chosen instrumentation influences the information to be gained from an experiment. Only the natural frequency, by manual excitation, or also damping and higher order modes when using an instrumented hammer. In order to understand the many experiments that are done worldwide, sharing of the results and being transparent on the methodologies of experimentation is very beneficial for making the most of any experiment. Experimental data should be published as is in digital format and not only as a by-product in a publication as figures limiting the use of it. © The Author(s), 2022.",Corrosion testing; DIC (Digital Image Correlation); Digital twin model; Experimental Methods; Fatigue testing; Full-scale iced load measurements; Health monitoring model; Hybride model testing; Hydrodynamic of Flexible Structures; Large scale impact testing; Scaling Laws; Vibrations; Wave-in-deck,Arctic engineering; Benchmarking; Data handling; Fatigue testing; Flexible structures; Hydrodynamics; Image correlation; Impact testing; Inspection; Offshore oil well production; Scaling laws; Sea ice; Seawater corrosion; Strain measurement; Structural health monitoring; Corrosion testing; Digital image correlation; Digital image correlations; Digital twin model; Experimental methods; Full-scale iced load measurement; Health monitoring; Health monitoring model; Hybride model testing; Hydrodynamic of flexible structure; Large scale impact testing; Large-scale impacts; Loads measurements; Model testing; Monitoring models; Vibration; Wave-in-deck; Offshore structures,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85158899064

Seaborne transportation is responsible for 90% of goods moved globally, and containerized shipments account for more than 50% of those goods. This volume of movement requires efficient tracking and traceability methods that secure the documentation process and ensure the involved stakeholders. However, due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust, lack of ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. To mitigate these problems, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based solution for the ownership history and traceability of shipping containers in the industry. Our solution utilizes smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate the inefficient shipping process by digitizing ownership transfer and process documentation. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the owners to auction off their cargo in the destination ports, freeing warehouses and containers in the process. We analyze our proposed system in terms of transaction costs and smart contract security. The smart contracts are developed using the Solidity language in the Remix IDE and the code is made publicly available on GitHub.",Blockchain; Ethereum; NFTs; supply chain; maritime shipping; auctioning; shipping containers,,,Article,,,,

With the gradual adoption of automation and digitalization onboard, modern ships are increasingly equipped with remotely monitored unmanned spaces such as the modern engine room. Marine engineers are no longer required to be co-located within the boundaries of the engine room to carry out their duties. Maritime Education and Training (MET) needs to evolve and reflect the developments in the changing work context wherein the marine engineer is removed from the physical work locale. Advancements in engine room simulator training are suited to modern and future ship operations. Situated in-context training has been the mainstay of competence development in shipping. Previously seafaring training took the form of on-board apprenticeships and gave way to shore-based MET provision over time. This led to an increase in the distance between the training environment and the context of work. This paper presents the recent developments in engine room simulator technology, the walk-through engine room simulator, and argues that the immersive training experience afforded by this novel technology facilitates near-context training especially for the technologically advanced and future ships. We envisage that in the future, the digital twin of the engine will be part of the digital space that constitutes the future workplace of autonomous ships. We discuss that utilizing the walk-through engine simulators affords a bridge between the current and the future autonomous engine room training. © AGA 2023.

This evolution is driven by advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Additive Manufacturing (AM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more importantly, Virtualization, including digital twin and simulation. Indeed, the implementation of these technologies and their transformative nature has changed the environment of workplace onboard ship and ashore, requiring the new and innovative training tools and systems. As defined by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the shift from traditional shipping to autonomous shipping will take through four degrees. In this classification, as the ships progress to degrees two and three, seafarers/operators require to be trained for the skills and competencies that enable them to remotely work with advanced systems and intelligent machines through a Remote Operation Center (ROC). These novel workplaces onboard ships and ashore accordingly are redefining new training tools and programs for seafarers. Simulators as a central and indispensable component in training systems from past to present has the capability to make a paradigm shift, bridging the gap between traditional onboard training and the SCC training environment to meet the autonomous ship operation requirements for seafarers.

Among the decarbonization tools, the most immediate solution for reducing carbon emissions is to reduce vessel waiting time near ports and increase operational efficiency.

Due to their low flammability and resistance to moisture, their performance is optimal in offshore platforms. Nonetheless, their thermal-electrical degradation must be carefully considered given the special wind and weather conditions in marine environments. The present paper studies the thermal aging of dry-type WTSU transformers in offshore wind farms considering the most thermally stressed location i.e. the winding hot-spot. The estimation of the transformer lifetime consumption introduced in this work can be applied in the framework of digital twins for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring purposes The thermal degradation study is based on a typical offshore load profile and includes the analysis of the impact of several transformer characteristics and operating conditions. As a result of the analysis, it can be concluded that lower temperature insulations, forced air cooling systems, a lower mean winding temperature rise and cool ambient temperatures lead to decreased loss of life values. Also, the present work suggests the suitability of considering thermal degradation studies as an optimal sizing factor for offshore WTSU given the low ambient temperatures in marine environment and the low capacity factors. © 2020, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.",Digital twin; Dry-type transformer; Hot spot temperature; Loss of life; Wind energy,Cooling systems; Electric utilities; Offshore oil well production; Temperature; Thermal aging; Winding; %moisture; Degradation study; Dry types; Dry-type transformer; Hotspot temperature; Hottest-spot temperatures; Loss of life; Marine environment; Step up transformers; Thermal degradation'; Offshore wind farms,"Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT1191-19, KK-2018/00096); Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU, (GIU18/181)",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085199438

First, a digital twin model for offshore platforms is established, and the key technical procedures required for each part of the model are given. Subsequently, to implement consistency maintenance between the virtual model and the physical entity during the digital twin usage, a finite element surrogate model approach based on Gaussian process is performed, which integrates with the crack growth consistency maintenance strategy using dynamic Bayesian network. Finally, according to service condition characteristics of the offshore platform, a crack growth experiment under mixed-mode multi-step loading is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the method not only reduces the influence of uncertain factors on crack growth prediction under complex loads, but also achieves accurate of crack growth through dynamic tracking. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twin; Dynamic Bayesian network; Fatigue crack growth; Gaussian process; Offshore platform,Bayesian networks; Cracks; Drilling platforms; Fatigue of materials; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Offshore oil well production; Consistency maintenance; Crack growth prediction; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Gaussian Processes; Growth trends; Modeling approach; Off shore platforms; Prediction methods; Surrogate modeling; Virtual models; Bayesian analysis; crack propagation; fatigue; Gaussian method; offshore structure; Fatigue crack propagation,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB1708000)",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121440387

In the information era, we are literally swimming in an ocean of structured and not structured data and thanks to the evolution in the Telecommunications technologies, all that information can be used from everywhere. However, information means nothing without the capability to analyze, extract conclusions and learn from it, which is way the technologies like treatment of Big Data and the Artificial Intelligence are crucial. Imagine how these technologies shall allow engaging the design of a part or any concept by applying rules, which will facilitate the design significantly, how the integration of the validation of the structural models by the Classification Societies will be linked directly by cloud applications. Imagine all the benefits of this two simple examples that can be implemented thanks to the potential of these technologies. The way we work with shipbuilding CAD tools is also changing thanks to the ubiquitous access to the information and the different hardware available to explode that information: AR, VR, MR, Smartphones, tablets, etc. Nevertheless, not only the way we work, but also the way we interact with shipbuilding CAD tools is changing, with technologies like natural language processes that allows having a direct conversation with the applications. The concepts that are absolutely clear from now to the future in shipbuilding is the use of Data Centric model and the concept of Digital Twin, a real and effective synchronization between what we design, what we construct, by covering the complete life cycle of the product thanks to technologies like IoT and RFID. This paper tries to explain the importance to understand how the new generations of naval architects and marine engineers are immersed in a technological world in constant and rapid evolution.

The increase in shipping generated by expansion of the Panama Canal and the development of the cruise industry are the two main factors which contributed to the shift in the Island's policy that aims to capitalise on the increase in the expected shipping traffic in the region. This article examines various areas and policies which have been implemented so far by the Port of Guadeloupe and considers the innovative ways used to achieve its objectives and raises the question as to whether the Guadeloupian development in the logistics area is likely to be a force to be reckoned with in the Caribbean region. Design/methodology/approach: The approach employed involves the analysis of material extracted from published articles and information from periodic progress reports obtained from the Port of Guadeloupe. Findings: The study showed that the Port of Guadeloupe had implemented various changes to achieve its objectives of becoming a major logistics hub in the region and “the smart port” of the Caribbean, which is likely to represent a challenge to Jamaica's aspiration to be the major port in the Caribbean. Research limitations/implications: Much of the published information accessed on the Guadeloupian Port and elsewhere is written in French, which could limit access to English speakers in conducting related research. Practical implications: Rapid logistic port development is taking place in the shipping arena in the French-speaking Caribbean and the Guadeloupian logistic hub's aim to be the number one “smart port” in the region could be realised sooner than expected. Social implications: If the Port of Guadeloupe achieves its objectives, it could impact on jobs in the shipping industry in the English-speaking Caribbean and affect people's standard of living. Originality/value: The question as to whether the Port of Guadeloupe is a threat to other Caribbean ports has not yet been explored and the findings of this investigation would be useful to other port authorities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Ferriera; Globalization; Guadeloupe; Logistics; Tourism,,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124989634

However, the evolution of residual stress distribution throughout the shipbuilding process is not well understood. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) techniques enable linking disparate software codes across multiple length scales, thereby facilitating simulation of the entire material lifecycle – from material processing to fabrication to structural performance. This project is pairing computational simulation with physical measurement for verification and validation (V&V) of the linked finite-element analysis (FEA) tools. The linked FEA tools enable simulation of representative marine structures. Concurrently, the residual stress in an analogous physical structure will be measured through each step of the fabrication process: incoming plate, edge-prep, fit-up, welded assembly, and post-fatigue testing. The effort will follow specific areas within the component to understand the effects of fabrication and testing on residual stress magnitude and distribution. This fabrication-cycle material information is essential to understand the initial state of marine structures as the industry moves towards a digital twin prototype standard.

However, the threats of anthropogenic and climate stressors on coastal environments highlight the need for robust monitoring to inform current and future environmental stewardship decisions. While traditional oceanographic sampling is typically done from a research vessel, this is often costly and logistically difficult for scientists and coastal communities alike. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) in partnership with communities along Canada's western, eastern, and Arctic coasts have continued to advance a number of solutions for long-term marine monitoring [1]. Ocean Sonics has enabled these programs as a collaborator, technology provider, and information resource [2]. Selecting which solutions to use and how to integrate them in to existing programs requires careful attention. This technical paper aims to outline many of the possible solutions and the considerations that go in to selecting ones that maximize benefits to the communities Ocean Sonics designs and manufactures the icListen, the world's first smart digital hydrophone [3]. These hydrophones are deployed across ONC's network of cabled underwater observatories for long-term ocean acoustic monitoring; they are also deployed as autonomous underwater moorings and used to collect data from boats and surface buoys. Each of the above data collection methods have their advantages and disadvantages when serving the needs of coastal communities. ONC currently supports year-round, real-time data collection from hydrophones deployed on eight different cabled Community Observatory sites across the country in addition to hydrophones located on ONC's larger VENUS and NEPTUNE observatories. Through use of a cabled observatory, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation [4] is working with ONC and others to collect acoustic data in Burrard Inlet, right next to Canada's largest port. Meanwhile, the Malahat First Nation (also located on Canada's southern west coast) is an example of a community that is working with ONC and Ocean Sonics to incorporate a number of ocean acoustic monitoring methodologies in to their existing marine monitoring programs [5]. Malahat Nation aims to use boat- based and other data collection methods as a possible long-term acoustic monitoring strategy in their marine territory, with the immediate focus of identifying optimal locations for seafloor cabled observatories that can monitor whale and vessel interactions. Other communities along Canada's three coasts are equally keen to generate and advance integrated monitoring programs that include the collection and analysis of underwater acoustic data. Here we discuss a number of underwater acoustic monitoring methods currently being considered, used, and adapted by coastal communities and how they may play a part in achieving their specific research goals, answering key questions, and informing future plans and even changes to government policy. It is crucial that the communities understand how these methods can be effectively integrated in to their other environmental monitoring efforts and that they consider their overall capacity to support acoustic data collection. Capacity, in this case, needs to include aspects such as technical and scientific expertise, available funding, people-time for data collection and administration, availability of support vessels and other equipment, and even the overall desire and willingness to partner with others. The relative presence and absence of any of these aspects will ultimately work to define which methods are feasible and to what extent service providers, such as ONC and Ocean Sonics, may to be involved. For example, both ONC and Ocean Sonics offer standardized training to help build technical and scientific expertise but depending on the overall capacity of a given community relative to the complexity of the data required to answer their questions, they will likely need additional support from ocean acousticians to analyze and interpret the data and may need more fundamental support in defining initial research questions. ONC's broad vision includes providing knowledge and leadership that deliver solutions to society in general; community-based approaches to collecting underwater acoustic data are one of the means to support this vision. ONC's Community-Based Monitoring and Science Services teams use subsea cabled Community Observatories, boat based data collection methods, autonomous moorings, vessel traffic data, and standardized training as just some of the wide spectrum of complementary tools available to them when working directly with leadership and monitoring teams in coastal communities. ONC and the communities they work with rely heavily on manufacturers and subject matter experts such as Ocean Sonics to provide technical solutions and expertise. The communities themselves are the driving force behind these monitoring efforts, providing not just the people time and resources but also the context and purpose for which the data is being collected.

In a maritime context, digital twins do not yet have a wide selection of standards to support interoperability among systems, undermining users’ ability to create a cohesive digital twin that combines multiple sources of data. This study proposes an open framework for modelling and organizing ship, sensor, and operating context data in digital twins. The framework is web-driven, allowing digital twin content and simulations to be accessed by distributed users. Two case studies based on the framework are presented. The first one explains how to manage ship and sensor data using taxonomies suitable across different stages of the lifecycle. A dashboard for browsing a digital model of the research vessel Gunnerus according to taxonomies for early design and operation is developed as a proof of concept. The second case study illustrates how the proposed data standards can be used to develop simulations accounting for some aspects of the vessel’s operating context. The digital Gunnerus model is used to develop a navigational simulator including surrounding terrain and nearby vessels. The challenges anticipated in scaling the framework toward industrial applications are discussed in terms of standards’ capabilities, compatibility, and of data governance. Plans of integrating the case studies with sensor streams to obtain true digital twins are outlined. ©2023: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",data standard; digital thread; Digital twin; interoperability; maritime; ship; taxonomy,Interoperability; Life cycle; Shipbuilding; Ships; Case-studies; Comprehensive modeling; Data standards; Digital thread; Maritime; Multiple source; Navigation simulation; Open frameworks; Real- time; Wide selection; Taxonomies,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167521849

A Digital Twin is in essence a digital representation of an asset that provides better insight into its dynamics by combining a priori knowledge of the system through mathematical models with online data acquired from sensors and instruments deployed in or at the physical asset. While the technology is seeing increased use across several different industrial, governmental and research sectors, and across scientific disciplines, its application within aquaculture is still in its infancy. However, due to the rapid ongoing development in technological methods in aquaculture, an increasing number of the building blocks required to make a Digital Twin for aquaculture purposes are becoming available. We set out to explore these possibilities by first defining a Digital Twin — what components it should contain, how it should be constructed, and outlining the capability levels of a finished Digital Twin. Our next step was then to explore the state-of-the-art within the different required components and enabling technologies within aquaculture, thereby identifying the current foundation for developing Digital Twin technology in this sector. Following this, we developed concrete case studies that elaborate upon how we by combining existing and developing new technological tools could envision developing Digital Twins for three application areas of high industrial relevance, namely oxygen conditions in sea-cages, fish growth in sea-cages and in-cage robotics and vehicle operations. In conclusion, we present our thoughts on the potential of Digital Twin technology in being a key component in ushering in Industry 4.0 in aquaculture, and outline a pathway on the way onward towards achieving this goal. © 2024 The Author(s)",Digital twin; Marine fish farming; Modelling; Precision farming,Fish; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Digital representations; Enabling technologies; Fish farming; Future prospects; Intensive aquacultures; Marine fish; Marine fish farming; Modeling; Precision-farming; Priori knowledge; data acquisition; future prospect; growth; instrumentation; intensive culture; knowledge; marine environment; numerical model; research work; robotics; sensor; technological development; Aquaculture,"Norges Forskningsråd, (313737)",Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183943174

One way the statute pursues this balance is through its provisions for ports. These provisions have functioned as a type of smart growth planning for ports, encouraging densification of existing port districts and possibly averting maritime commercial and industrial sprawl along the California coast. One unintended consequence of the encouraged consolidation of port activities, when combined with the rapid growth in international trade over the last four decades, has been disproportionally large environmental and health impacts on low-income and minority communities surrounding ports. This article examines how the Port of Long Beach's conformance with the California Coastal Act has resulted in ongoing environmental justice concerns. It discusses approaches employed by the Port of Long Beach to reduce environmental justice concerns resulting from significant and unavoidable environmental impacts and offers suggestions for how to address this issue.",California Coastal Act; Coastal Zone Management Act; environmental justice; Port of Long Beach; ports,,,Article,,,,

This paper presents the major achievements of the project. The DTSS aims to grasp the stress responses over the whole ship structure in waves by data assimilation that merges hull monitoring and numerical simulation. Three data assimilation methods, namely, the wave spectrum method, Kalman filter method, and inverse finite element method were used, and their effectiveness was examined through model and full-scale ship measurements. Methods for predicting short-term extreme responses and long-term cumulative fatigue damage were developed for navigation and maintenance support using statistical approaches. In comparison with conventional approaches, response predictions were significantly improved by DTSS using real response data in encountered waves. Utilization scenarios for DTSS in the maritime industry were presented from the viewpoints of navigation support, maintenance support, rule improvement, and product value improvement, together with future research needs for implementation in the maritime industry. © The Author(s), 2024.",Data assimilation; Digital twin; Hull monitoring; Maritime industry; Ship structure,Inverse problems; Data assimilation; Data driven; Hull monitoring; Maintenance supports; Maritime industry; Navigation support; Optimal data; Ship operation; Ship structure; Structural performance; Hulls (ship),,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189081396

It is expected that future fully automated smart ports will be data-driven, harvesting power from advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. Under the hood, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are considered as an enabling foundation of new data sources for innovations and high-level automation. Thus, enterprise data management becomes critical when implementing IoT projects. However, the implementation of data management needs to be governed. Although the IoT adoption in smart ports receives significant interest from the port authority, the effectiveness of the IoT adoption lacks proper evaluation and support of comprehensive data management policy and guidelines. By using the systematic literature review and a case study to analyze the current gaps in IoT data governance research, this research shows that IoT data governance still needs to catch up in smart ports. In particular, compared to other industries, data lifecycle management and data quality management are two key data governance areas that should receive increasing attention from the port authorities. It is believed that with adequate data governance, smart ports can truly harvest the power of IoT to improve operational efficiency and sustainability with an increasing level of automation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",data governance; internet of things; Smart ports,artificial intelligence; automation; data management; maritime transportation; port development; shipping; sustainability,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144194926

Results demonstrate that the network achieves stabilized and accurate temporal predictions of the system states, successfully forecasting the evolution patterns of individual cavitation events.

A virtual container yard that syncs with a physical container yard in the ACT digital twin system for observation and validation is developed. A mathematical model is established to minimize the total energy consumption of completing all tasks.

Then, the framework and main steps of the proposed approach are described. The physical operation space is mapped into the virtual space, and both spaces keep synchronized to support the verification of solutions. A mathematical programming model and Q-learning algorithm are used to generate the AGV scheduling plan considering battery charging.

This study combines digital twin and machine learning to tackle AGV path planning problems in the time-changing operation environment. A digital twin-based AGV scheduling approach is developed to obtain the real-time data from the physical ACT. Based on the information of the dynamic factors obtained, a mathematical model is formulated to minimize the transportation time of AGVs. Subsequently, the path planning schemes solved by machine learning are used asinput to the virtual ACT for validation and optimization.

This proposal adopts the predictive modelling of wind turbines by digital twins by deep learning strategies. Initially, the data is acquired from publicly available wind turbine datasets. Next, the deep features and statistical features are extracted, and the autoencoder is adapted to get the deep features. Then, the Enhanced Marine Predators Algorithm (EMPA) is to select the optimal weighted fused features, where the EMPA would tune the weights used for fusion and the features selection. Finally, the predictive modelling is done via a newly recommended Adaptive Deep Temporal Convolution Network with an Attention Mechanism (ADTCN-AM). It is tuned for precise outcomes with the help of EMPA for forecasting the wind speed and predicting the generated power.

We conclude that a completely different port terminal worker has emerged with a different job role and skills profile. Unlike the traditional 'wharfie' the emerging terminal worker is well educated and highly skilled.

LNG carriers are inherently complex vessels, featuring a high degree of integration of their energy conversion systems, all operating under time and load varying mission profiles, making design decisions non-trivial. To this end, DNVGL COSSMOS (Complex Ship Systems Modelling and Simulation) in-house process modelling framework is used to build digital twins of the propulsion and cargo module of LNG carriers, modelling the entire energy conversion process from cargo tanks to useful energy required for propulsion, electricity and heat. Emphasis is given on reliquefaction systems and the improvement they provide in performance, comparing the currently available technologies and giving deeper insight for the Joule-Thomson systems. The overall ship system performance is improved by 5–15% along the low vessel speed range and 25–40% for the anchorage loaded port condition, when partial reliquefaction systems are considered, depending on the configuration they are compared to.

Its unique capacity is to 'Engineer with the Human Factor in the loop' independent if this Human Factor is the client, designer, fabricator, marine warranty surveyor or the offshore operator. In the conventional engineering tools the Human Factor cannot be included and in the conventional engineering process the preparation is done by engineers without much involvement of the operators. It is as if engineering and execution are separate worlds. Being able to bring these worlds together efficiently in an early stage has already led to an efficiency improvement for all parties (i.e. client, fabricator and offshore operator) involved and has improved the Operational Excellence offshore.

The concept of Digital Twin was first introduced by Michael Grieves at the University of Michigan in 2003 through Grieves' Executive Course on Product Lifecycle Management. Winning a Formula 1 race is no longer just about building the fastest car, hiring the bravest driver and praying for luck. These days, when a McLaren technology group races in Monaco or Singapore, it beams data from hundreds of sensors wired in the car to Woking, England. There, analysts study that data and use complex computer models to relay optimal race strategies back to the driver. The McLaren race crew and the online retailers both harness data and use algorithms to make reasonable projections about the future, Parris explains. The concept is called Digital Twin [1]. A Digital Twin contains information such as a piece of equipment or asset, including its physical description, instrumentation, data and history. A Digital Twin can be created for assets ranging from a well to a piece of equipment to an entire oilfield. For example, a subsea system could have a Digital Twin via a simulation model of a subsea system's components, including the blowout preventer, tiebacks, risers, manifolds, umbilical and moorings. Drilling and extracting simulations can determine whether virtual designs can actually be built using the machines available,"" GE said.

The interaction of WPTs with ship dynamics are also considered in terms of thrust as well as added resistance due to induced side force and roll motion. Predictions of WPT efficacy over a range of relevant wind speeds and directions are provided to indicate the energy capture available for various conditions at sea. Finally, estimations of fuel savings over a real-world route are provided using the proportion of total power demand delivered by the WPT and available fuel consumption data for the main propulsion engine.

The twine Reynolds number is (Formula presented.), making it experience various local drag coefficients. The DT was built with OrcaFlex (OF) aiming at: (i) avoiding over- or under-designing the system; (ii) supporting the scale-up of the system; and (iii) estimating the costs and/or the impact of our offshore operations. Therefore, we present an attempt to build an accurate DT using data from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). We developed a three-cycle validation: (i) initial guess applying Naumov’s semi-empirical drag coefficient to define the OF drag coefficients without the influence of the angles of attack (Formula presented.) of the wings; (ii) adjustment of the OF drag coefficients using AquaSim (AS) with its twine-by-twine drag correlation for various (Formula presented.) ; (iii) re-adjustment of the OF drag coefficients from two-dimensional CFD simulations using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for a twine-by-twine establishment of a drag correlation on a 1 m plane net, highlighting the shielding effects for (Formula presented.).

Their positive impact on the supply chain is enabling processes to be optimized through smarter production. In the case of Spain, the Spanish public entity Puertos del Estado (Puertos del Estado is a public business entity dependent on the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and the Urban Agenda, with overall responsibility for the entire state-owned port system.) has launched Ports 4.0, the largest open innovation fund for the logistics-port ecosystem. It is therefore necessary to know the point of digitalization in which the Spanish ports are and the present scenario in which they develop their activity. For this purpose, a SWOT analysis (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats analysis) is proposed, which is an ideal tool to make a reliable diagnosis of the port system in relation to a certain project before which we wish to make a strategic decision, in this case digitalization, in order to establish a concrete action plan in this regard. This should be the first step towards developing the Ports 4.0 project. The main conclusion of the analysis is that Spanish ports are currently at a medium high level of digitalization, and that they continue to update and innovate in order to be increasingly competitive in this market, despite the fact that there is still a long way to go in digitalization. The main challenge for Spanish ports is that technology alone is not useful enough to reach Ports 4.0 status; the technology also needs to be used in an integrated, open and joint way by all the agents of the port community, which is one of the main handicaps at present. © 2020 by the authors.",Delphi panel; digitalization; intermodality; Spanish port system; strategic analysis; SWOT matrix,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122199090

The task of ensuring food import safety is a responsibility shared by a multitude of actors in the food industry, encompassing everyone from farmers, producers, and retailers to federal and state regulatory agencies. If America's food supply is to remain secure, it is critical that everyone involved in this process remain vigilant and knowledgeable about the requirements of food safety, particularly within the context of international trade involving multiple players. The manuscript talks about the various multiple actor programs like Container Security Initiative (CSI), the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), Free and Secure Trade (FAST), the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA 2002), Bio-terrorism Act, the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS, adopted in 2002 as an international counterpart for the MTSA), the 24-hour Rule, Automated Targeting System (ATS), Operation Safe Commerce (OSC), and the Smart and Secure Tradelanes (SST) initiative. Port security encompasses numerous issues ranging from the security of actual port facilities to the verification of passenger identities and the investigation of threats posed by cargo container shipments. The paper highlights that greater linkage of resources, expertise, and initiatives are needed at all levels of government and in the private sector in order to achieve the shared objectives of security and emergency preparedness. It is important to note that preventing problems that can arise outside the United States is a more effective approach than merely attempting to identify and catch problems when products arrive at our borders. The paper concludes by reiterating that public-private partnership must become stronger in order to improve the quality and safety networks upon which the U.S. relies to supply the food we eat and the products we use.",food import safety; port security; public-private partnerships; governance; C-TPAT,,,Article,,,,

A system simulation can be utilized to enable many of these functionalities. Co-simulation based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is typically used to interface component models independently developed in different modelling platforms, possibly having different supplier intellectual property restrictions. Currently, more than 170 software tools support FMI, a subset of which also support co-simulation. In this paper, a methodology for the selection of a co-simulation platform for a maritime DT is presented. The methodology is demonstrated for two maritime energy system case studies with different DT purposes and users, that represent different phases of a ship’s lifecycle. MATLAB/Simulink and Open Simulation Platform (OSP) are used as example co-simulation platforms. The DT’s purpose and its users are considered to understand the functional and interface requirements for a qualitative comparison of the platforms. Additionally, the platforms’ performance is compared quantitatively by co-simulating Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) of the component models. The derived requirements, as well as the platforms’ capabilities and offerings, are then analyzed to select a suitable platform.

The proposed solution integrates data driven models on the actor level for route forecasting that utilize vessel specific features and are adapted according to the system requirements and the limitations of AIS streaming service networks. Leveraging the forecasting functionalities, the platform is able not only to detect but also forecast events of interest for the entire global fleet accurately and consistently without any memory or system issue and continuously generate predictions for 170K vessels during performance experiments, which demonstrates the high scalability and versatility of the proposed architecture for global maritime digital twin applications. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Automation; Automatic identification system; Data-driven approach; Maritime operation; Movement pattern; Physical environments; Real- time; Route predictions; Scalable systems; Traffic-state estimations; Virtual representations; Forecasting,"S-VRF; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (957237, 101092749); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190967872

Through Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0, ports have faced with digital transformation based on networked cyber physical systems to be a part of smart and intelligent transportation systems. However, besides the advantages, this transformation has brought cyber security gaps and threats which can be resulted in breakdowns in maritime transportation domain. Therefore, port and port facilities should be prepared for cyber threats through holistic risk assessment frameworks for developing proactive actions. Based on these facts, this study has proposed to apply an integrated cyber risk assessment method for a container port with a cyber-physical perspective through analyzing four exemplary cyber-attack scenarios. For each cyber-attack scenario, risk assessment methodology has been applied using integrated cyber security management approach by taking into account the cyber physical assets of the container port. Results show that for the specified cyber threats, the risks have been evaluated non acceptable. Mitigation strategies have also been presented briefly in conclusion. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A workshop is a complex combination of multiple functions. Previous studies regarding workshop scheduling showed several problems, such as delayed rescheduling response, single influencing factors, and the separation of machine tools and vehicles. Therefore, to address these issues, this paper constructs a multi-factor scheduling service system with various factors, such as machine failure, tool wear, and product quality. Combined with the international background of rising energy prices, the scheduling scheme is evaluated while having two goals to achieve: minimizing the completion time and achieving energy consumption flexibly by controlling the different parameters’ values. Introducing digital twin theory, machine fault prediction, tool wear prediction, and product quality monitoring can achieve the timeliness and predictability of the workshop scheduling, the joint scheduling of machine tools, and the vehicle transport tasks. Finally, the superiority of this method is verified by processing some critical parts in a marine diesel engine workshop. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Digital twin; Dynamic scheduling; Multi-objective optimization; Rescheduling,Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Job shop scheduling; Machine tools; Quality control; Vehicles; Wear of materials; Dynamic job shop scheduling; Dynamic scheduling; Job-shop; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Reducing energy consumption; Rescheduling; Shop efficiency; Tool wear; Workshop Scheduling; Multiobjective optimization,"Hudong Heavy Machinery Co.

These modules together constitute a system for predicting and recovery the time-series matrix composed of scene frames and object frames.

Down-scaled replicas enable studying large systems in a cost-effective and less laborious manner. The test bench was equipped with instrumentation able to research dynamic effects, loads and vibration acting in a real azimuth thruster. Two servomotors were used in each end of the powertrain. The other acted as the drive motor and the other was used to create excitations and load from the propeller side. Torsional vibration was detected by measuring the twist of the shafts and by utilizing torque transducers. Analysis of the measurement data indicated that the lowest resonance frequencies of the test bench were similar to full-scale thrusters. The revealed dynamic properties suggested by the measurement data enabled the test bench to be concluded as adequate for emulating the torsional dynamics of the full-scale thrusters.

Improving hydrodynamic model accuracy without compromising computational efficiency has always been of high interest for safe and cost-effective marine operations. With continuous development of sensor technology and computational capacity, an improved digital twin concept for vessel motion prediction can be realized based on an onboard online adaptive hydrodynamic model. This article proposes and demonstrates a practical approach for tuning of important vessel hydrodynamic model parameters based on simulated onboard sensor data of vessel motion response. The algorithm relies fundamentally on spectral analysis, probabilistic modelling and the discrete Bayesian updating formula. All case studies show promising and reasonable tuning results. Sensitivities of the approach with respect to its key parameters were also studied. Sensor noise has been considered.

In the maritime and the energy industries, digital twins have been mainly used for system condition monitoring, project visualization, crew training, real-time decision making/support, and predictive maintenance based on onsite measurement data from onboard sensors. Such a digital twin normally presumes the vessel's operational condition by assistance from sensors and engineering judgement. However, a vessel's operational condition and loading state may shift quite often due to the frequently changing operational scenarios, tasks, and environmental conditions. In addition, the true vessel state (e.g., inertia distribution) may deviate from the intended one according to planning due to possible engineering errors. Even though there are sensors helping to monitor vessel condition such as draft monitoring systems and ballast systems, several important vessel parameters are difficult to measure directly, e.g., moment of inertia, center of gravity, and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping. This paper proposes a framework for monitoring vessel condition and providing decision support based on quantitative risk assessment, through a vessel state observer which is able to self-tune the important but uncertain vessel parameters by utilizing the available prior knowledge, vessel measurements, and information about the associated sea states. The tuned vessel parameters improve the information about the real-time vessel condition and consequently assist to improve the prediction accuracy of vessel seakeeping performance in the near future for the emerging wave conditions. Furthermore, the tuned results and the response prediction can then be applied to a decision support system, quantitatively evaluating potential risk and providing suggestions. The framework consists of 5 modules, i.e., wave data acquisition and processing, vessel data acquisition and processing, vessel seakeeping model tuning, real-time vessel motion and critical structural response prediction, and risk awareness and avoidance. Details of each module are described in the paper. The proposed framework can also assist in the development of autonomous ships. © 2021 by ASME",,Artificial intelligence; Condition monitoring; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision support systems; Ocean currents; Risk assessment; Risk perception; State estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Condition; Crew training; Decision supports; Different domains; Energy industry; Operational conditions; Project visualization; Real- time; Risk-based decisions; States observer; Forecasting,"NFR, (237929); Norges Forskningsråd",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117081072

The digital twin then serves as a platform for data management, asset monitoring, and inspection and maintenance management, featuring an improved basis for cost effective operations and future decision making in terms of e.g. life extension. The present paper deals with application of the digital twin concept in marine operations where it is essential to handle the inherent uncertainties of vessel performance by applying a model that can adapt to the real operating conditions. In this paper a case study is presented for identifying the most sensitive parameters in the vessel hydrodynamic model w.r.t. the vessel motion RAOs. The study also shows that the parametric sensitivity depends on the interesting vessel response parameter, wave direction and loading condition. A digital twin adaptive to various operational conditions may require parametric tuning of the numerical model. It is important to identify the correct parameter(s) for modification. A simplified and idealized case study is also carried out to test the requirements to a successful parameter identification for model tuning.

In this paper, we introduce an innovative digital twin-based method for diagnosing faults in autonomous ships. Our digital twin system collects data from the ship's sensor array, conducts comprehensive analysis, computes fault parameters, and provides real-time visualizations of the findings. To achieve this, we utilize the ship's dynamical model and employ a novel adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) algorithm to estimate the severity of these faults. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach through numerical simulations and practical implementation in an autonomous surface vehicle called the Otter, developed by Maritime Robotics.

The issue of problem structure is placed in focus, that is, to what degree the specific characteristics and complexity of intentional versus accidental oil spill risks affect institutional responses. It is shown that whereas the risk of accidental oil spills primarily has been met by technical requirements on the vessels in combination with Port State control, attempts have been made to curb intentional pollution by for example increased surveillance and smart governance mechanisms such as the No-Special-Fee system.

It allows analysis of data and monitoring of marine systems to avoid problems before they occur, and plan for the future by using simulations.

Co-simulation addresses this problem, allowing different sub-systems to be modelled independently, but simulated together.

In order to accommodate this goal, a novel co-simulation solution, developed in cooperation by members of the Norwegian maritime industry, is presented.

Control-oriented modeling offers a solution, cutting calibration time and enabling robust control strategies. Simultaneously, real-time, physics-based engine models (digital twins) are emerging as they offer better predictive capability and scalability than typical mean-value, data-driven approaches. This study explored development of a control-oriented digital twin of a Wärtsilä 4L20 marine engine. Starting from a detailed one-dimensional model (GT-Suite), it explored reduction strategies toward a fast-running engine model (FRM), balancing the calculation speed and accuracy trade-off. Finally, the FRM was tested for real-time implementation on a target machine. Comprehensive experimental data from the 4L20 platform in the VEBIC Engine Laboratory provided the baseline for model calibration. Model calibration and validation covered four representative operating points and involved correlation of crank-angle, resolved in-cylinder pressures, thermal state at several locations of the engine air-path and relevant performance indicators. The results shed new light on the feasibility of digital twins in the marine engine domain. The obtained FRM was three times faster than real-time, while the accuracy loss was comfortably within the 5% tolerance levels for the governing outputs, including crank angle resolved in-cylinder pressure. The grid-resolved simulation was obtained with four times fewer flow components and internal discretization length of 100% and 150% of the cylinder bore for intake and exhaust components respectively. The balance between predictivity, accuracy and real-time surplus, was ultimately more favorable than in state of the art automotive applications and enables exploring further coupling with semi-predictive emission sub-models. The real-time capable FRM is considered applicable in hardware-in-the-loop simulation, and this application is scheduled in a follow-up project. © IMechE 2022.",1D-simulation; digital twin; engine control; fast-running engine model; Marine diesel engine; mid-speed engine,Balancing; Diesel engines; Marine engines; Real time control; Robust control; 1-D simulation; Crank angle; Engine control; Engine modeling; Fast-running engine model; Marine Diesel Engines; Mid-speed engine; Real- time; Real-time implementations; Speed engines; Economic and social effects,Business Finland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133624528

A port that is today at the forefront of this trend is characterized as a fifth generation (5G) port, a “smart port” or, more recently, a Port 4.0. These characterisations, introduced by Maritime Studies literature, are closely equivalent to the business model concept developed by the Strategic Management literature in the last decades. This research paper inquires on the influence that Industry 4.0 technologies might have on the adoption of more sophisticated business models by seaports, and the mechanisms through which this influence is driven: in particular the role that technology push and market pull mechanisms might play. To this end, it develops a conceptual model that aims to provide an explanation of the relationship between the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the evolution of seaports' business models. This model is then evaluated against an exploratory case study on the port of Barcelona.

This study further developed an expert questionnaire based on 25 evaluation indicators and evaluated the key indicators of smart port service quality and their causal relationships using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and decision making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The results of this study showed that the key smart port success factors are: (1) accurate and secure delivery of cargo; (2) accurate electronic document transfer; (3) rapid provision of port berths to shorten the turnover time of ships; (4) convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures; (5) transparent information integration on a single platform; and (6) use of big data to arrange container transport. Causal relationships were found among the indicators, including the fact that “convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures” was influenced by “accurate electronic document transfer,"" “transparent information integration on a single platform,” and “use of big data to arrange container transport.” The results of this study can help port operators and government agencies identify key success factors for smart ports. This will enable participants in the supply chain to take early measures to respond to the impact of emergencies in the post-pandemic era, thus improving port operations and customer satisfaction.

To study the application prospects of high-fidelity digital models to the maritime field, this study adopts the blended-wing-body underwater glider (BWBUG) as an example. A novel construction approach of an underwater simulation platform is proposed based on digital twin (DT) technology. The building process is described from the perspectives of geometry, physics, environment and behavior. Based on the Gazebo simulation platform, the proposed approach includes the construction of a high-fidelity model for underwater scenarios and is equipped with a vehicle body containing various sensors. Under the influence of ocean currents, the twin sensor data are integrated in the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control algorithm, combined with a robot operating system (ROS), to achieve its pitch attitude control. The overshoot was reduced to at most 0.06% and the settling time is reduced to 29.5 s compared with the traditional PID. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only validates the implementability of control algorithms for unmanned systems in actual marine environment, but also has the potential for performance prediction, design improvement, and safety assessment in the next generation vehicle design process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",BWBUG; Digital twin; Gazebo; ROS,Attitude control; Automobile bodies; Computer operating systems; Hydrodynamics; Ocean currents; Proportional control systems; Simulation platform; Application prospect; Blended wing body; Blended-wing-body underwater glider; Digital modeling; Gazebo; High-fidelity; Marine environment; Novel construction; Simulation platform; Underwater gliders; algorithm; complexity; construction method; marine technology; model test; model validation; research work; ship design; technology adoption; underwater vehicle; unmanned vehicle; Robot Operating System,"National Basic Scientific Research Program, (JCKY2019207A019)",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146083279

The digital twin applications in aviation and marine industries are presented and the main steps of developing a digital twin are discussed. The three main steps of sensors (measurements), model, and data analysis are identified and used in the study. The lessons from two recent accidents in the aviation industry (Boeing 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019) are studied in details and discussed. It was found that the sensor reliability, model failure and wrong decisions as the output of the data processing are among the risks associated with digital twin implementations. In particular, from the case study accidents, it was found that the digital twin may not be able to represent all the possible scenarios which a system may experience in its life time. The digital twin presents many advantages, however the implementation of the digital twin is associated with risk and high uncertainties, even in the industries like the aviation industry, where the digital twin is well established and at a higher advanced level than in the marine industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Accidents; Civil aviation; Data handling; E-learning; Marine applications; Ships; Aviation industry; Boeing 737; Ethiopia; Indonesia; Life-times; Model failure; Sensor reliabilities; Marine industry,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076700394

Failures and accidents in the cruise ship industry attract the global media and can severely impact reputation and business performance of companies and authorities involved. A system approach investigation and analysis - CAST - was employed with the aim to maximize learning from the Viking Sky's failure through a systematic approach and to contribute to failure reduction in the cruise ship industry. Three main recommendations emerged from this study: an overview of the accident or failure precursors and resilience indicators; safety recommendations for other cruise ships; lessons and strategies of actions for the increased cruise operations in the Arctic and Antarctic areas. It was found that several accident or failure precursors, for example, a low level of lubricating oil, the failure of a turbocharger, an inoperative large diesel generator, lack of functionality for safety equipment due to bad weather, and others precursors contributed to failure and highly critical situation encountered by Viking Sky in Hustadvika. Resilience indicators such as the master's immediate decision to launch mayday, the crew preparedness, and the way how the emergency situation was handled were found to have positive impacts on critical situation of Viking Sky. This article highlights also that adaptations and improvement of standards and regulations for harsh environmental conditions can play an important role in prevention of marine accidents. Furthermore, for a better understanding of correlation between environmental loads and their effects on machinery systems, digital solutions such as digital twin for condition monitoring of cruise ships in the Polar areas are seen as possible innovative solutions yet to be fully implemented in the marine industry. © 2021 The Author(s)",Blackout; Cruise ship; Engine failure; Hustadvika-Norway; Learning; Marine accidents and Digital Twin; Viking Sky,Accident prevention; Accidents; Condition monitoring; E-learning; Environmental regulations; Failure (mechanical); Ship propulsion; Blackout; Business performance; Cruise ships; Engine failures; Hustadvika-norway; Learning; Learning from failures; Marine accident and digital twin; Systems approach; Viking sky; Ships,"European Commission, EC; Norges Forskningsråd, (311502)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103686829

Seaports, as large scale end-users, aim to adopt energy management systems (EMS) since energy prices have increased over years and sustainable operations is a key target for greening the port industry. Many seaports start to install fully electrified equipment and use electricity as the source of energy because electricity consumption, instead of carbon-intensive energy sources, contributes to the climate change mitigation targets. In this study, a mixed integer linear programming model is suggested to solve the integrated operations planning and energy management problem for seaports with smart grid (e.g. port microgrid) considering uncertain renewable energy generation. The operations planning aims to determine the number of quay cranes (QCs) and yard equipment to assign to each ship for each one hour period. It also determines each ship's berthing duration which affects the hourly energy consumption due to the cold ironing and the available reefer containers. These plans result in energy demand. Meanwhile, energy management matches energy demand and supply considering different energy pricing schemes and bidirectional energy trading between energy sources (e.g. utility grid, renewable energy sources) and energy storage systems. Results indicate that significant cost savings can be achieved with smart grid (port microgrid) compared to conventional settings. Deploying energy storage systems in port microgrid results in important cost savings. Energy consumption is dominated by QCs, cold-ironing and reefer containers. Finally ports which harness renewable energy obtain significant costs savings on total cost. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, they must demonstrate integrated low-emission energy production, distribution, and supply, as well as sustainable alternative infrastructure for refueling ships, cargo handling equipment, and other vehicles inside port boundaries. To address this issue, ports must progress toward smartening their operations. This requires intelligent infrastructure and components, with smart energy infrastructure being one of the most crucial ones. It is a part of port energy management systems (EMSs) and works based on modern technology to balance energy demand, distributions, and supply while transitioning to renewable energies.

The digital industrial revolution has been underway for more than a dozen years. Industry 4.0 and the idea of digital twins (DT) are becoming the focus of virtually all industrial sectors. Some sectors are more predisposed to digitalization, while for others, the process is much more difficult. This mainly depends on the specific characteristics and susceptibility of a given industry, including the current degree of digitalization of companies, as well as the knowledge and mental readiness of employees. The individual characteristics of an industry are important. Shipbuilding is a traditional industry where the level of digitalization is still low. As a result, the efficiency of shipbuilding processes and the quality of ships built are not sufficiently controlled. The article addresses this problem, reviews work in the field of digitalization of shipbuilding processes, and identifies the needs and challenges in this area. The article proposes the concept of a DT system for the entire ship design and production process. Key areas of digitalization of the actual processes were defined, and a division was made into planning, monitoring, and process analysis activities. Special attention was paid to the area of dimensional quality control, and the dimensional quality management metasystem (DQMM) was introduced into the comprehensive DT system. The requirements were defined, and the limitations of the proposed solution were identified, taking into account a number of external factors, including the degree of readiness of the manufacturer—the shipyard. The developed DT system concept was tested using the example of the construction process of a simplified ship. Practical aspects of the implementation of the proposed solution, in particular, DQMM, were pointed out. © 2023 by the authors.",digital twin system; digitalization; dimensional quality control; product life cycle; quality management; shipbuilding; shipyard; technology applied to maritime industry,industrial development; knowledge based system; planning method; quality control; ship design; shipbuilding,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164125691

Subsequently, a methodology is applied to develop the DT of a marine engine for healthy conditions, which is extended to represent a wider operating envelope considering systematically identified anomalies. The results demonstrate that the developed DT trustworthiness is assured, as the validation step provided errors within ±3%, the verification step provided sound trade-offs, whereas the robustness assessment step confirmed acceptable uncertainty ratios. Subsequently, the DT is employed to generate datasets required for developing a data-driven model for anomaly diagnosis, which exhibits an accuracy of 98.8% for anomaly detection, 97.6% for anomaly identification, and 90.1–91.8% for anomaly isolation. This is the first study addressing the trustworthiness of DTs for marine engines, and as such advances concepts of the fourth industrial revolution to the shipping industry. © 2024 by the authors.",anomaly diagnosis; digital twin; first-principle models; marine engines; simulation-based dataset generation; trustworthiness assurance,,"Military Suicide Research Consortium, MSRC; DNV AS; RCCL; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (815012); Innovate UK, (99958)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191373446

This study seeks to estimate the interrelationships among barriers in the evolution of maritime port smartification (MPS) using the case of China. The research framework exhibits fifteen barriers selected from the previous literature and experts’ inputs. The causal relationships among the identified barriers were examined by using an integration of grey theory and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method (DEMATEL). The barriers were divided into a causal group with eight barriers and an effect group with seven barriers. Further analysis of the results leads to the identification of nine key barriers such as unfavorable policies of investing and financing, low level of cooperation between port business and government functions, shortage of talents in smart ports. Insufficient government support in R&D is the most influential causal barrier, and undeveloped awareness of the benefits of new technologies has the most association with other barriers. The findings encourage more detailed investigations on the barriers and help policy-makers formulate strategies to accelerate the evolution of MPS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Barriers; China; Grey-DEMATEL; Interrelationships; Maritime ports; Smartification,China; efficiency measurement; governance approach; maritime transportation; policy making; port development; port operation; research and development; strategic approach; technological development; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation policy; transportation technology,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114804261

To remain competitive and improve its productivity, a port needs to build its digital capability and become a ‘smart’ port. Despite its increasing importance, port digitalisation is largely under-researched. Our research explores how information integration afforded by the recent development of Port Centric ICT systems (PCIS) may impact port performance. A survey was conducted in Qingdao Port, the seventh-largest comprehensive port in the world. We adopted the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique for analysis. Our model focuses on testing the mechanism of information integration on port performance among the port community members; that is, both internal information integration and external information integration and their direct and indirect impact on port performance. Our main contribution lies in that our study identifies two clear pathways for developing a port’s digitalisation processes to achieve competitive advantages: a) the mediated path, where port performance will improve if information integration is coupled with port community operational capability (PCOC); b) the direct path, where the innovative use of PCIS leads to radical ideas, new business models and transformative changes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digitalisation; information integration; pls-sem; Port community; port-centric ict system; survey,China; Qingdao; Shandong; digitization; information and communication technology; least squares method; numerical model; performance assessment; port operation; survey,"G-YBTM; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (201713011); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (17CCXJ19)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119986699

Numerical sensor data (motions at two points) are acquired from the reference model and inputted to two separate digital twin models (single riser models). In the digital twin models, there is no environmental load as input, while only time histories of sensor data are inputted at sensor locations as boundary conditions. Time histories and statistical values of the riser's estimated and actual motions, bending moments, and tensions are compared, which demonstrates the feasibility of the developed digital-twin-based monitoring.  © 2022 IEEE.",digital twin; monitoring; riser; riser behavior; riser stress,Floating production storage and offloading; Marine risers; Mooring; Mooring cables; Time domain analysis; Fully-coupled; Global behaviors; Global motion; Reference modeling; Riser; Riser behavior; Riser stress; Sensors data; Steel lazy wave riser; Stress monitoring; Digital storage,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145772429

This paper presents condition monitoring of drivetrains in marine power transmission systems through digital twin approach. A literature review regarding current operations concerning maintenance approaches in todays practices are covered. State-of-the-art fault detection in drivetrains is discussed, founded in condition monitoring, data-based schemes and model-based approaches, and the digital twin approach is introduced. It is debated that a model-based approach utilizing a digital twin could be recommended for fault detection of drivetrains. By employing a digital twin, fault detection would be extended to relatively highly diagnostic and predictive maintenance programme, and operation and maintenance costs could be reduced. A holistic model system approach is considered, and methodologies of digital twin design are covered. A physical-based model rather than a data based model is considered, however there are no clear answer whereas which type is beneficial. That case is mostly answered by the amount of data available. Designing the model introduces several pitfalls depending on the relevant system, and the advantages, disadvantages and appropriate applications are discussed. For a drivetrain it is found that multi-body simulation is advised for the creation of a digital twin model. A digital twin of a simple drivetrain test rig is made, and different modelling approaches were implemented to investigate levels of accuracy. Reference values were derived empirically by attaching sensors to the drivetrain during operation in the test rig. Modelling with a low fidelity model showed high accuracy, however it would lack several modules required for it to be called a digital twin. The higher fidelity model showed that finding the stiffness parameter proves challenging, due to high stiffness sensitivity as the experimental modelling demonstrates. Two industries that could have significant benefits from implementing digital twins are discussed; the offshore wind industry and shipping. Both have valuable assets, with reliability sensitive systems and high costs of downtime and maintenance. Regarding the shipping industry an industrial case study is done. Area of extra focus is operations of Ro-Ro (roll onroll off) vessels. The vessels in the case study are managed by Wilhelmsen Ship Management and a discussion of the implementation of digital twins in this sector is comprised in this article. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

At the core of this Digital Twin are two components: The Integrated Marine Monitoring System (IMMS) installed on the FPSO, and BMT DEEP, a cloud-based platform that stores, manages, integrates, post-processes and displays the vast data sets collected by the IMMS as well as other data sources. This paper focuses on harnessing the benefits of Digital Twin Technology, by bringing in data from all sources and enabling to synthesize and monitor the FPSO in near real-Time from any remote location. This Digital Twin is designed to allow rapid query of the data by filtering with any time window in terms of hour, day, month, quarter, and year of data collection for the life of the asset. Several sensors feed data to the Glen Lyon IMMS. The sensors include FPSO motion, stress response monitoring, and metocean monitoring. In addition to the FPSO based measurements, metocean data is also available from Met Office weather buoy K7, and wind measurements from the nearby Clair platform. A composite of the measured metocean parameters is generated from the quality control of the data. This qualitycontrolled data is visualized on DEEP as a time series, as well as comparisons with the basis of design data for the facility in terms of several statistical charts that form the metocean and structural dashboards.

Different seaports are in different phases of system implementation that allows uninterrupted data flow and interconnections. For example, some Croatian cargo seaports can be considered “ports in development”, meaning they are currently only trying to simplify business processes. The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure plays an important role in the development of Croatian seaports, as it has recognized the importance of digitalization and stakeholder connectivity (shippers, freight forwarders, maritime agents, etc.), and has taken concrete measures to achieve digitalization and connectivity. Initially, it is necessary to enable system integration and stakeholder connectivity within the seaport, and subsequently connect the seaports with each other. The first step in the transition of Croatian seaports into smart ports is the development of both the Port Community Systems and the National Single Window. Later on, the goal should be to introduce the appropriate smart technologies, which should result in various benefits e.g., accelerated cargo manipulation. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

This reduction can be conducted by either using a compliant fuel with lower sulfur content, an alternative fuel (e.g. LNG, methanol), or clean its exhaust gasses with a ""scrubber"" technology to reduce the output of CO2, NOx and SOx emissions. The objective of this paper is to present a holistic approach to continuously monitor and estimate the emissions of a vessel as well as to assess and improve the efficiency of scrubbers. Furthermore the deployment of a cutting-edge, integrated framework, incorporating the latest technological advances, that can offer the ability to capture, process and analyze vessels' operational data in order to improve efficiency, sustainability, and rule compliance is presented. Particularly the conceptualization and materialization of a big data application suite that exploits the IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) advancements and technologies, to employ a “digital replica” of the en-route vessel is demonstrated. By collecting a multitude of features from on-board sensor installments, we present how we can effectively utilize these features, harvested in real time, in order to accurately assess and estimate the environmental footprint of the vessel by employing robust Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) predictors. Then we describe in detail the streamlined procedure from data acquisition to model deployment, utilizing the proposed big data framework, in order to assess and estimate the emissions during the operational state of the vessel. Finally, we demonstrate experimental results by deploying comparative analysis utilizing operational data from one containership-centric Living Lab (LL) in order to validate and confirm our approaches in terms of accuracy and performance in a real world setting.

Fuel-Oil-Consumption (FOC) estimation, constitutes one of the key components in maritime transport information systems for efficiency and environmental compliance. This paper deals with FOC estimation in a more novel way than methods proposed in literature, by utilizing a reduced-sized feature set, which allows predicting vessel's Main-Engine rotational speed (RPM). Furthermore, this work aims to place the deployment of such models in the broader context of a cutting-edge information system, to improve efficiency and regulatory adherence. Specifically, we integrate B-Splines in the context of two Deep Learning architectures and compare their performance against state-of-the-art regression techniques. Finally, we estimate FOC by combining velocity measurements and the predicted RPM with vessel-specific characteristics and illustrate the performance of our estimators against actual FOC data. © 2023 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Delaunay triangulation; Digital twin; Ensemble learning; Fuel oil consumption estimation; Least squares optimization; Quadratic estimators; Splines; Time-series forecasting; Unsupervised clustering,,"Danaos Shipping Co.; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (874990); Stavros Niarchos Foundation, SNF; Horizon 2020",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85158042304

The offshore inspection, repair and maintenance (IRM) market was USD 8.93 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow to USD 18.04 billion by 2028 [1]. At present, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) generally supported with large offshore support vessels (OSVs), have established themselves as indispensable for offshore IRM operations. Key emerging technologies such as 3D computer vision, mixed reality, digital twinning, and machine learning, coupled with significant advances in robotics, automation, sensors, and communication now make it possible to consider performing a range of undersea tasks using undersea vehicles without a tether, but under careful human supervision. It is now possible to radically redefine the meaning of the words ""tethered system"" through a hybrid approach by including virtual tethering via high frequency acoustic or optical communication at a short range, and with an extremely small optical fiber base station providing remote surface connectivity. By collaborating with an onshore/offshore remote human operator and a digital twin of the environment, battery-powered, tetherless hybrid underwater vehicles (HUVs) will be able to perform a range of tasks at a remote location that might otherwise require a conventional ROV and a support ship on site. The Collaborative Human Robot Inspection & Intervention System (CHRIIS) is aimed towards providing remote intelligent tetherless solutions to inspection and light intervention of offshore marine assets. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.",,Environmental technology; Inspection; Mixed reality; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Optical fiber communication; Optical fibers; Remotely operated underwater vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Concepts of operations; Disruptive technology; Energy sector; Human robots; Offshore energy; Offshores; Prioritization; Repair and maintenance; Support vessels; Underwater environments; Remotely operated vehicles,"AME; IAF-PP, (A20H8a0241); Industry Alignment Fund; Industry Alignment Fund-Pre-Positioning; RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156148906

So, in the branch of marine technology, the mentioned technologies are also being applied to obtain more features and to automate marine-related operations as well as creating novel smart devices. As a result of this, traditional ports and ships are being replaced by smart ports and vessels. To achieve this transition, numerous applications need to be developed to make them smart. The purpose of this paper is to present a dedicated an IoT-based system for automating linkage procedures by searching for available locations via port-mounted sensors and planned ship notification.

It is worth to mention that novel technologies are being directed towards obtaining more improvements in the field of Marine. Applying the IoT in particular industries makes that industry’s working process automation and creates various smart devices in the field. Also, in Marine, the process comes out identically to those industries. Namely, smart ports and smart ships substitute traditional ports and vessels. However, it should be considered that applying the technologies in the fields is not effortless. Perhaps, this process should be done pace by pace. So, building a smart ship and smart port which is expected to be the fundamental basement of shipping requires much time. To obtain it, traditional versions of the objects in the field should be alerted to smart substitutions and the processes also should be automated by dividing them into parts. In this paper, we presented a system which is dedicated to automating the mooring process of ships. The premium target of our IoT based system is finding vacant places automatically by using the sensors fixed at the port and transfer the data to the ships which are going to berth.

One of the main challenges of existing S2SC systems is the lack of interoperability between shore-side charging systems and onboard power system configurations. To address this issue, the proposed S2SC concept is designed to provide charging to multiple ships with various onboard configurations and vessel missions. To reduce the impacts of grid outage events and grid capacity limitations on the charging performance, an On-Shore Battery (OSB) unit is considered. This OSB is connected directly to a common dc bus, without a dedicated OSB converter to ensure a cost-effective solution. Furthermore, the power converters are designated to serve multiple functions while forming an integrated configuration. This can enable increased utilization of the infrastructure. Moreover, a charging management system is introduced as a high-level controller to deliver stable, controllable, and prioritized shore power to multiple vessels. This high-level controller regulates the OSB power and State-of-Charge (SoC) while ensuring the charging service during grid outages and limited grid capacity conditions. As a proof of concept, the complete model of a S2SC designed for supplying four different vessels is simulated and the control performance is validated via a series of case studies.

The combination of high frequency data and the employment of advanced analytical technologies offers the shipping industry a great advantage. Continuous data monitoring enables reactive energy performance improvement/optimization, while it allows building up realistic performance models that are used for optimizing the commercial management of the vessels and serve as a basis for new projects. Vessel operational profile monitoring along with voyage planning through optimized speeds and weather routing, effective monitoring of hull & propeller bio-fouling, trim optimization, assessment of innovative solutions installation (i.e., waste heat recovery systems, energy saving devices, new painting schemes, etc.) are practices widely used nowadays to address GHG emissions reduction plan and performance optimization.

Offshore wind farm projects require large-scale ecological surveys before, during and after construction, in order to assess potential effects on the distribution and abundance of protected species. The robustness of site-specific population estimates depends largely on the extent and design of spatial coverage and the accuracy of the applied census technique. Standard environmental assessment studies in Germany have so far included aerial visual surveys to evaluate potential impacts of offshore wind farms on seabirds and marine mammals. However, low flight altitudes, necessary for the visual classification of species, disturb sensitive bird species and also hold significant safety risks for the observers. Thus, aerial surveys based on high-resolution digital imagery, which can be carried out at higher (safer) flight altitudes (beyond the rotor-swept zone of the wind turbines) have become a mandatory requirement, technically solving the problem of distant-related observation bias. A purpose-assembled imagery system including medium-format cameras in conjunction with a dedicated geo-positioning platform delivers series of orthogonal digital images that meet the current technical requirements of authorities for surveying marine wildlife at a comparatively low cost. At a flight altitude of 425 m, a focal length of 110 mm, implemented forward motion compensation (FMC) and exposure times ranging between 1/1600 and 1/1000 s, the twin-camera system generates high quality 16 bit RGB images with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2 cm and an image footprint of 155 x 410 m. The image files are readily transferrable to a GIS environment for further editing, taking overlapping image areas and areas affected by glare into account. The imagery can be routinely screened by the human eye guided by purpose-programmed software to distinguish biological from non-biological signals. Each detected seabird or marine mammal signal is identified to species level or assigned to a species group and automatically saved into a geo-database for subsequent quality assurance, geo-statistical analyses and data export to third-party users. The relative size of a detected object can be accurately measured which provides key information for species-identification. During the development and testing of this system until 2015, more than 40 surveys have produced around 500.000 digital aerial images, of which some were taken in specially protected areas (SPA) of the Baltic Sea and thus include a wide range of relevant species. Here, we present the technical principles of this comparatively new survey approach and discuss the key methodological challenges related to optimizing survey design and workflow in view of the pending regulatory requirements for effective environmental impact assessments.",Biological Monitoring; Digital Surveys; Environmental Impact Assessment; Marine Wildlife; Offshore Wind,,,Conference paper,,,,

Furthermore, we discuss the applications of our proposed method in various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace, maritime and shipping, and city management.

A wide range of industrial fields have already benefited from digital twins technology such as aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, city management and maritime and shipping. Furthermore, recent research works are starting to study the integration of digital twins for computer networks to allow more innovation and intelligent management. One of the basic building blocks of digital twins technology is the Internet of Things where wireless sensors and actuators are deployed to ensure the interaction between the physical and digital worlds. This type of network is complex to manage due to its severe constraints especially when it controls critical industrial applications, resulting in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We believe that the optimization of the IIoT will lead to efficient integration of Digital Twins in Industry 4.0. In this paper, we design a Network Digital Twin for the IIoT where sensors, actuators and communication infrastructure are replicated in the digital twin to enable intelligent real-time management of such networks. This way, new networking services such as predictive maintenance, network diagnosis, resource allocation, energy optimization with other intelligent services can be efficiently integrated and exploited in the network life-cycle. We validate the proposed architecture by providing a promising prototype implementation that should unleash the full potential of the network digital twin. © 2022 IEEE.",Digital Twin; Industy 4.0; Internet of Things,Actuators; Life cycle; Aerospace manufacturing; City management; Industrial fields; Industrial systems; Industy 4.0; Innovation management; Performance; Physical systems; Rapid adaptation; Recent researches; Internet of things,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137114362

Digital twins can help predict the output of a wind turbine using a variety of environmental data generated by real-world systems. This paper dealt with the development of a physics-based output prediction model (P-bOPM) for a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) for a digital twin. The wind power generator dealt with in this paper was modeled considering the NREL 5 MW standard wind turbine with a semi-submersible structure. A P-bOPM of a 10 MW FOWT for a digital twin was designed and simulated using ANSYS Twin Builder. By connecting the P-bOPM developed for the digital twin implementation with an external sensor through TCP/IP communication, it was possible to calculate the output of the wind turbine using real-time field data. As a result of evaluating the P-bOPM for various marine environments, it showed good accuracy. The digital twin equipped with the P-bOPM, which accurately reflects the variability of the offshore wind farm and can predict the output in real time, will be a great help in improving the flexibility of the power system in the future. © 2022 by the authors.",digital twin; hybrid analysis and modeling; offshore wind turbine; reduce order model,Forecasting; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Analysis and models; Design evaluation; Design implementation; Floating offshore wind turbines; Hybrid analysis; Hybrid model; Physics-based; Prediction modelling; Real- time; Reduce order model; Offshore wind turbines,"Changwon National University, CWNU",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137916590

Smart ships and reducing ship greenhouse gas emissions are among the most actively researched topics in the maritime transport industry. Owing to the massive advances in information and communications technology, the internet of things, and big data technologies, smart ships have emerged as a very promising proposition. Numerous methodologies and network architectures can smoothly collect data from ships that are currently in operation, as is currently done in research on reducing ship fuel consumption by deep learning or conventional methods. Many extensive studies of stacked autoencoders have been carried out in the past few years. However, prior studies have not addressed the development of algorithms or deep learning-based models to classify the operating states of ships. In this paper, we propose for the first time a deep learning-based stacked autoencoder model that can classify the operating state of a ship broadly into the categories of At Sea, Stand By, and In Port, using actual ship power load data. In order to maximize the model's performance, the stacked autoencoder architecture, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons contained in each layer were measured by performance metrics such as true positive rate, false positive rate, Matthews correlation coefficient, and accuracy. It was found that the model's performance was not always improved by increasing its complexity, so the feasibility of developing and utilizing an efficient model was verified by comparing it to real data. The best-performing model had a (5-128) structure with latent layer size 9. It achieved a true positive rate of 0.9035, a false positive rate of 0.0541, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9054, and an accuracy of 0.9612, clearly demonstrating that deep learning can be used to analyze ship operating modes.",ship mode; autoencoder; ship mode classification; deep-learning model,,Korea Institute of Marine Science and Technology Promotion (KIMST) - Korea Coast Guard [20190460],Article,,,,

It is commanded by a controller algorithm whose optimum parameters is subject to change with respect to the changes in the environment. The ship's response with respect to these variations in the controller parameters need to be tracked to develop a full understanding of the ship's autonomy. As such, it is believed that the digital twin of a ship is an essential component of the path to fully autonomous ships. Despite maritime institutions not giving the credit to it yet, the ship digital twin concept is expected to be one of the leading topics in marine engineering soon. In this study, we try to establish the ship digital twin concept in terms of navigation autonomy. The paper starts by introducing the path to full autonomy in seas and the need for the digital twin by defining this concept for ships. A maneuvering mathematical model is used to represent the physical ship. The details of the model and the controller algorithms are given next. The propeller and rudder models are first validated by free-running self-propulsion and turning circle tests. The ship considered in this study has a twisted rudder and does not possess course-keeping ability; therefore, it requires autopilot to move straight ahead. Three types of simulation cases are identified with one being the autopilot mode. In the other two cases, the ship is forced to conduct two hard maneuvers while accelerating/decelerating. Investigation of the generated results reveals the effectiveness of the digital twin architecture used in this study. It has also allowed us to conduct a controller stability analysis, which has shown the behavior of the controller gains to detect the most optimum values for the considered model ship. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Autonomous ship; Level 2 autonomy; Maritime autonomous surface ships; Maritime digital twin,Air navigation; Controllers; Propellers; Ship propulsion; Autonomous ship; Controller algorithm; Digital environment; Level 2; Level 2 autonomy; Maritime autonomous surface ship; Maritime digital twin; Optimum parameters; Real time response; Surface ship; algorithm; automation; computer simulation; control system; digitization; marine technology; navigation aid; numerical model; optimization; real time; ship motion; ship technology; vessel; Rudders,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149865798

In this context, port terminal storage yard operation is key, since complexity and poor coordination lead to containers stacked without consideration of retrieval schedules, resulting in time and energy-consuming reshuffling operations. This problem, known as the block relocation (and retrieval) problem (BRP), has recently gained considerable attention. Indeed, there are promising solutions to the BRP. However, the literature views the problem in isolation, optimizing one operational parameter for one of the many port stakeholders. This often leads to efficiency losses since port processes involve different stakeholders and port parts. In this work, we explicitly focus on scheduling trucks for pick-up for hinterland distribution. Appointments are often postponed in order to minimize reshuffling operations, leading to losses for the transport forwarders and decreasing the competitiveness of the port. We discuss the trade-off between minimizing container reshuffling operations while maintaining scheduled time windows for container retrieval. We describe the multi-objective optimization problem as a weighted sum of the two objectives. Given the complexity of the problem, we also present a greedy heuristic. Our results indicate that the number of schedule deviations can be reduced without significantly affecting the number of relocations compared to solutions that consider only the latter. Ideally, a weighting of 0.4 and 0.6 should be applied, reflecting schedule deviations and relocations, respectively, to achieve the highest joint optimization potential. This demonstrates that in complex environments, such as ports, with multiple interacting stakeholders and processes, coordination of solutions yields significant benefits.

An emerging technology that has the potential to substantially increase the efficiency of the multifaceted and interconnected port processes is the digital twin. Although digital twins have been successfully integrated in many industries, there is still a lack of cross-domain understanding of what constitutes a digital twin. Furthermore, the implementation of the digital twin in complex systems such as the port is still in its infancy. This paper attempts to fill this research gap by conducting an extensive cross-domain literature review of what constitutes a digital twin, keeping in mind the extent to which the respective findings can be applied to the port. It turns out that the digital twin of the port is most comparable to complex systems such as smart cities and supply chains, both in terms of its functional relevance as well as in terms of its requirements and characteristics. The conducted literature review, considering the different port processes and port characteristics, results in the identification of three core requirements of a digital port twin, which are described in detail. These include situational awareness, comprehensive data analytics capabilities for intelligent decision making, and the provision of an interface to promote multi-stakeholder governance and collaboration. Finally, specific operational scenarios are proposed on how the port's digital twin can contribute to energy savings by improving the use of port resources, facilities and operations.  © 2013 IEEE.",Digital twin; IoT; smart city; smart port; supply chain,Decision making; Energy conservation; Internet of things; Ports and harbors; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Cross-domain; Emerging technologies; Environmental footprints; IoT; Literature reviews; Research gaps; Road; Seaport; Smart port; Technological solution; Smart city,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164811315

The study of shell variations of these organisms requires observations at high stratigraphic resolution, which entails morphometric measurements from thousands of specimens. The collection of such data is time-consuming because specimens need to be oriented prior to imaging. In our studies about menardiform, globorotalids through time automatic devices were developed to orientate and image specimens under incident light. A first prototype-Automated Measurement system for shell mORphology (AMOR)-was realized in 2009 and was proven to be advantageous for gathering morphometric data. AMOR consists of a motorized universal tilting stage enabling an automatic orientation of specimens in a multicellular slide under a motorized binocular microscope. After the collection of images from the oriented specimens, shell parameters can be extracted and analyzed using separate digital imaging and morphometric software. AMOR was strongly tuned to Globorotalia menardii, a species with a quasi-symmetrical biconvex geometry in a keel view and often with a non-circular periphery in an equatorial view. Improvements of the software driving AMOR now allow the orientation of spiro- and umbilico-convex profiles and with circular forms in an equatorial view such as in phylogenetically related species like Globorotalia miocenica and Globorotalia multicamerata. Program AMOR v. 3.28 was given more flexibility using a scripting language for automatic control of the Windows graphical user interface. This approach was used to allow combinations of fix orienting functions in AMOR, which released us from reprogramming of the sophisticated LabView code. Scripting of core functions enables developing portfolios of adapted recipes for processing the morphologies that are beyond the menardiform morphogroup. To further expand on this concept, a follow-up robot-System AMOR 2-was completed in March 2020. It integrates the modified hardware, a newer digital camera, the updated software (AMOR v. 4.2), and improved functions. The present contribution describes the development from old AMOR to its newer twin, with the perspective of building a fleet of robots for the imaging of the oriented foraminifera in parallel.",AMOR; automation; orientation; imaging; foraminifera; morphometry; Globorotalia menardii; methods,IDENTIFICATION; EVOLUTION; ATLANTIC,,Article,,,,

By the same token, there could be stressed out subject, which secures this pillar like International organizations (as inter-governmental as non-governmental), states, ship-owners, etc. Third economic pillar concerns preventing to use financial tricks, getting around frauds like money laundering, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance for easy earning. One of the sources is in a free port zone. Besides, digitalization can help to improve maritime activity accounting sustainability. New cloud-based technologies such as big data platforms and digital twin technologies help to manage information, make decisions more quickly or reduce paper bureaucracy. Moreover, in 2019 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed three stages for its accomplishment like optimization, extension, and transformation. © 2019, National University Odessa Law Academy.

Therefore, the minimization of engine operating cost per flight-hour is a key aspect for airlines to operate successfully under challenging market conditions. The interaction between maintenance cost, operating cost, asset value, lease and replacement cost describes the area of conflict in which engine fleets can be optimized. State-of-the-art fleet management is based on advanced diagnostic and prognostic methods on engine and component level to provide optimized long-term removal and workscoping forecasts on fleet level based on the individual operation. The key element of these methods is a digital twin of the active engines consisting of multilevel models of the engine and its components. This digital twin can be used to support deterioration and failure analysis, predict life consumption of critical parts and relate the specific operation of a customer to the real and expected condition of the engines on-wing and at induction to the shop. The fleet management data is constantly updated based on operational data sent from the engines as well as line maintenance and shop data. The approach is illustrated along the real application on the CFM56-5C, a mature commercial two-spool high bypass engine installed on the Airbus A340-300. It can be shown, that the new methodology results in major improvements on the considered fleets.

Despite the contemporary 6DOF models can be used to predict ship motions in irregular waves, the impact of their stochastic realization is usually neglected and remains under-investigated. Especially in the case of turning, differences arising from the stochastic representation of the waves may result in excessive ship motions or even stability failure during maneuver execution. Therefore, in this study, statistical distributions of maximum amplitudes of roll, pitch, and lateral acceleration calculated in two representative locations on board a passenger vessel were analyzed concerning stochastic wave realization and existing extremes. The research utilized 6DOF simulation data and numerous realizations of the irregular wave with random phases of its components. Furthermore, the required number of wave realizations allowing for capturing the actual ranges of ship response at an assumed confidence level has been determined and analyzed. Ultimately, the results were compared in the safety-critical cases concerning various wave and operational conditions.

The primary output of the digital twin is a set of dynamic watch circles which are generated based off the predicted drift-off behavior of the MODU under real-time environmental conditions. The watch circles, together with vessel and weather status information, are displayed to the crew on board and updated on an hourly basis. This paper describes the development of the software platform on which the digital twin is built, together with the underlying drilling system model and solution parameters, which uniquely include the effect of the marine riser restoring force. Integration with external data streams is presented, including vessel position and heading, riser tension, and environmental data (wind, wave, and current). The system outputs, including the local user interface on the vessel and the output data stream to the operator’s real-time data center via the WITSML protocol, are also described. The digital twin with dynamic watch circle output has been successfully utilized on a campaign of shallow-water wells for plug-and-abandonment (P&A) operations in concert with BOP tethering and subsea realtime monitoring systems. Together, these systems ensured safe operations and wellhead protection in a challenging environment for dynamically positioned MODUs. Additionally, the operator was able to gather correlated data streams monitoring the weather conditions, vessel status, dynamic watch circle estimation, subsea drilling system status, and tether loads. The digital twin and dynamic watch circle system enables drilling and completion operations to be performed under conditions judged to be untenable when evaluated via traditional operability analysis methods involving statistically predicted environmental conditions. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

Therefore, in ports, shore-to-ship power (Cold Ironing) supply is an alternative way to overcome the pollution issue at shipyards. However, different ships of different countries and different companies require different types of power with different electrical connections, such as ac power with 50 Hz and 3-phase 3-wire connection, ac power with 60 Hz and 3-phase 4-wire connection, ac power with 50 Hz and 1-phase 2-wire connection, dc power, etc. The ship's power requirements are always in the megawatt range and its required potentials are in the kilovolt range. Therefore, in this article, a smart high power charging network and its control mechanism are developed for cold ironing on the ports, which is capable of serving almost all types of power with different types of power supply network. This developed supply system is capable of providing ac power, dc power, 50 Hz frequency, 60 Hz frequency, single phase, three phases, 3 wire, 4 wire, and 5 wire networks, different ac, dc voltages, etc. The capability of the developed smart power network is validated for different types of ships and vessels, on the simulation platform as well as through experimentation on real-time hardware-in-the-loop.

In the starting stage, electric vessels charging stations are being implemented on the most busiest commercial ports, where modern electronic devices are used to serve different types of vessels. These devices only take care of the quality of output power. However, on the input side, it creates a serious harmonic issue. During CI, megawatt range of power is supplied to the ships, so generated harmonics and interharmonics in the high-power supply based charging system become more dangerous for the grid. In this article, we propose a novel power quality improved cold ironing (PQICI) system (charging mechanism) to overcome this issue. Moreover, due to inherent multipurpose useability, this novel PQICI is able to supply different types of power to various types of vessels, such as ac power, dc power, 50 Hz frequency, 60 Hz frequency, single phase, three phases, three-wire network, four-wire network, five-wire network, and different ac and dc voltages. Furthermore, this PQICI supply system is capable of serving four vessels at a time. In every type of loading condition with different kinds of power supply mode, the PQICI maintains the power quality on the input side, with fulfilling the varieties of the power demand of vessels. The capability of the developed 'PQICI' system is tested for different types of ships and vessels on the simulation platform as well as through real-time hardware-in-the-loop experimentation. On IEEE standard 519, satisfactory test results on both platforms show the efficiency of the developed system and its control mechanism.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Cold ironing (CI); electric vessels; high-power charging station; power quality; smart port,Electric rectifiers; Harmonic analysis; IEEE Standards; Rectifying circuits; Ships; Wire; Charging station; Cold ironing; Electric vessel; High power; High power charging station; Marine vehicles; Power; Rectifier; Seaport; Smart port; Power quality,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129349737

In IoT-enabled MTS, the smart maritime objects, infrastructure associated with ship or port communicate wirelessly using an open channel Internet. The intercommunication and incorporation of heterogeneous technologies in IoT-enabled MTS brings opportunities not only for the industries that embrace it, but also for cyber-criminals. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an effective security strategy that uses artificial intelligence models to understand cyber-attacks and can protect data of IoT-enabled MTS proficiently. Unsurprisingly, most of the existing CTI-based solutions uses manual analysis to extract relevant threat information, and has low detection and high false alarm rate. Therefore, to tackle aforementioned challenges, an automated framework called DLTIF is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. The proposed DLTIF is based on three schemes: a deep feature extractor (DFE), CTI-driven detection (CTIDD) and CTI-attack type identification (CTIATI). The DFE scheme automatically extracts the hidden patterns of IoT-enabled MTS network and its output is used by CTIDD scheme for threat detection. The CTIATI scheme is designed to identify the exact threat types and to assist security analysts in giving early warning and adopt defensive strategies.

In Europe about 48 million citizens regularly participate in recreational marine activities (36 million of whom are boaters), as well as countless numbers of tourists. Over 6 million boats are kept in European waters while 4,500 marinas provide 1.75 million berths both inland and in coastal areas [1]. Thanks to the proposed Smart Port concept, this scenario could be considered as an energy resource to improve renewable energy penetration and enlarge European grid storage capacity with negligible investments by exploiting existing facilities. Starting from statistics assessment of ports and boats present on the Mediterranean Shore [2] (particularly in Liguria region) and considering data related to the Italian national electric market (daily spread between minimum and maximum price of electricity, daily renewable energy production and their impact on the price [3]), different scenarios are analyzed according to different kind of generators (photovoltaics, wind) and storage technologies [4] (batteries, hydrogen) commonly used in the nautical sector in order to study the most profitable solutions. A case study in Italy is presented and the expected impacts in terms of yearly renewable deliverable energy, storage capacity, CO2 emission savings and money savings for boat owners and port managers is shown. This framework is analyzed at the present conditions and looking throughout future scenario that will include an increase of the number of electrical boats, a variable price of electricity and a decreasing price of batteries and hydrogen equipments as storage technologies. Considering the number of boats actually moored in the Italian marinas and equipped with renewable generators, relevant installation capital costs could be saved while the structural improvements that should be made to the ports are limited to the electrical connections and the smart control systems transforming it in an energy district able to interact with the electrical market through the national grid as a renewable generator or an energy buffer useful to the grid balance. The first required investment for the port will be the installation of bidirectional POD (point of delivery) and energy-meters, in order to make boats able to exchange energy with the grid while they are moored. It is important to underline that smart controls have to be investigated in order to guarantee a relevant state of charge of boats batteries.

It presents the European Marine Observation and Data Network-EMODnet as an exemplar in marine domain. EMODnet has significantly advanced European capability for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable marine knowledge, offering access to standardized and harmonized in-situ marine data and added value data products across seven marine environmental themes. Open and free data, products and associated metadata, are available for discovery and access through a wide range of web/data services. These ensure that the wealth of existing ocean observations and marine data collected in Europe and beyond can be easily discovered and used by a growing, and diversifying, user community. Interoperability with key services is crucial toward a pan-European and global approach. Key partnerships include the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service and international initiatives, e.g., the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange. Looking at societal tools and applications, the chapter provides a case study of the European Atlas of the Seas, a web-mapping tool that communicates marine and other open-source data and information in an attractive and interactive way. The EU Atlas is a key tool for the European ocean literacy initiative EU4Ocean, contributing to engage citizens and drive the societal change that is required for Europe to meet the ambitious targets to be climate neutral by 2050. The paper introduces examples of emerging tools for data visualization and presents hackathons, a powerful method to cocreate and innovate applications for society. Finally, the chapter looks toward the digital era and addresses the emerging challenges and opportunities of marine data, e.g., big data and plans for a digital twin of the Ocean, as tools to enable a step-change in societal connection, understanding, and action regarding the ocean. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

That share could be 25% by 2050 - a significant contribution to climate change. Some studies indicate that as of 2020, the main source of atmospheric emissions of certain pollutants (such as sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxide) will be attributable to the shipping sector, thus exceeding the inland sources. An interesting alternative to reduce the level of pollution caused by ships when docked in ports is connecting to shore side electrical power, known as cold ironing. The new concept of zero emissions' port is referred to a port powered mainly from renewable energies in order to fulfill its power requirements and to reduce the air emissions mainly using this concept for the emerging cold ironing regulation.

More interestingly, a strategic tendency in seaport advancement has been to manage the seaport system using a model which balances environmental volatility and economic development demands. An energy efficient management system is regarded as being vital for meeting the strict rules aimed at reducing the environmental pollution caused by port facility activities. Moreover, the enhanced supervision of port system operating methods and technical resolutions for energy utilisation also raise significant issues. In addition, low-carbon ports, as well as green port models, are becoming increasingly popular in seafaring nations. This study comprises a comprehensive assessment of operational methods, cutting-edge technologies for sustainable generation, storage, and transformation of energy, as well as systems of smart grid management, to develop a green seaport system, obtaining optimum operational efficiency and environmental protection. It is thought that using a holistic method and adaptive management, based on a framework of sustainable and green energy, could stimulate creative thinking, consensus building, and cooperation, as well as streamline the regulatory demands associated with port energy management. Although several aspects of sustainability and green energy could increase initial expenditure, they might result in significant life cycle savings due to decreased consumption of energy and output of emissions, as well as reduced operational and maintenance expenses.",Green seaport; management strategy; clean energy; decarbonization; sustainable maritime,INTEGRATED BERTH ALLOCATION; QUAY CRANE ASSIGNMENT; SHORE SIDE ELECTRICITY; CONTAINER TERMINALS; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; CARBON FOOTPRINT; PORT ACTIVITIES; SHIP EMISSIONS; AIR-POLLUTION; CO2 EMISSIONS,,Article,,,,

This study utilizes modeling and simulation techniques to analyze the operational behaviors of the subsystems and confirm data communication between them. The targeted system in the study is a naval combat system (NCS), which is a typical type of defense cyber-physical system (CPS). Three types of models were designed for the simulation testing of the NCS: a combat-management model for simulating the overall computational activities, physical models to confirm the intrasubsystem behaviors, and data integration models to test the intersubsystem communications. These models are realized with the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern, which strongly facilitates graphical user interfaces being decoupled from model logic and data. We consider underwater combat scenarios as an application. Six significant physical subsystems within the NCS are simulated and tested: a ship-steering system, an inertial navigation system, a global navigation satellite system, a periscope, sonar systems, and a plotting board. We expect that the proposed work will play a principal role when analyzing the behaviors and communications of defense CPSs and providing an environment for functional testing as a digital twin. © 2022 Dong-Chul Lee et al.",,Computation theory; Cyber Physical System; Data integration; Graphical user interfaces; Information management; Integration testing; Network security; Sonar; Data-communication; Development systems; Functional testing; Modeling and simulation techniques; Naval combat systems; Operational behavior; Simulation testing; System development; System levels; System-of-systems; Embedded systems,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124109505

The paper starts with a broad definition of computer vision, and how it can be adapted to reverse engineering. It is followed by a modest literature review of cases in the maritime sector, namely photogrammetry, inspection and survey. Later, it describes a recent project supervised by the first author, using commercial software to re-model digitally the hull of a small sailing boat. The use of open-source tools is later mentioned, exemplified by the research conducted by the second author on the use of cameras as sensors for acquiring dynamic data, closing the digital twin loop. A proposal for the use of image data extraction is presented at the end, as a substitute for the expensive re-sensoring of vessels in operating, in the current hype of remote operation and digital twins.

The gathered data can then be processed utilizing the post processing software which requires a paid license. Evolution of Smart Bathymetry is important where the automated aggregation of whatever type of National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) based hydrographic sensor data as per the survey requirements. The Smart Bathymetric Survey Kit (SBK) is a compact unit and consists of a built-in pre-processing unit with real-time file transfer mechanism by Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) using a wireless MODEM. This avails a near real-time post processing of the survey data and the possibility to concentrate or resurvey a specific location in case of the bad quality data during the survey. Thereby avoids the unnecessary survey reattempts which involves the cost, time and human effort. Also, the kit is developed to provide cost effective data collection and the possibility to make fast and reliable decisions on the studies such as dredging estimates without much survey effort. Since the GPS interface is required for any type of bathymetry, a web application with the offline map featured with the customizable bathymetric grids with the real time course, velocity and heading details of the survey boat. This enables the surveyor precisely to follow the grid knowing the real time location of the survey boat. Few modern telemetry systems take advantage of the low price and ubiquity of GSM networks by using SMS to receive and transmit telemetry data to the host. But the type of wireless transmission is site specific, hence the kit was developed with the flexibility to interface with 2.5/5 GHz or a VHF/UHF MODEM. The kit contains a Single Board Computer (SBC) coded with LabVIEW to acquire and pre-process the NMEA sentences from the hydrographic sensors such as single beam echo sounder, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), Motion Reference Unit (MRU) and Differential GPS etc., a wireless MODEM and a DC-DC converter-based power supply unit to regulate the auxiliary power supply to the kit. Lead-acid battery or a mobile power bank can be used as the auxiliary power supply. The kit is designed to interface with a maximum of ten hydrographic sensors with the auto identification of COM ports and the baud rates. The sample collection rate and file size can be configured as per the survey requirements. All the printed circuit boards and interconnecting cables are housed inside an IP68 enclosure. LabVIEW was used to program to implement the required algorithm for the digital interface of the hydrographic sensors, auto scanning and identification of COM ports, encoding and pre-processing, DATA handling, redundancy storage and file management.

As part of its strategic response the UK is looking to follow other countries, especially in the EU and Asia, in investing in developing smart ports which incorporate advanced digital technologies. However, the UK is faced with the challenge of resolving many decisions regarding where to invest, what to invest in, the consequence(s) of those decisions, and how to regulate a future sector that is increasingly becoming dependent on digital information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. Smart ports can bring benefits locally, nationally and globally from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating efficient supply chains, and secure and safer working environments. Yet, embedding emerging technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT) into critical infrastructure like ports introduces new security risks and vulnerabilities that existing governance mechanisms are often unable to address. This paper firstly examines the growth in digitalisation of seaports drawing on initiatives in Rotterdam and Singapore. Potential security risks and vulnerabilities emerging are then discussed using some case studies before turning to review existing cybersecurity governance measures for ports. The lessons the UK can learn from smart port leaders like Rotterdam and Singapore as it looks to implement the innovation and digitalisation element of its new Maritime Strategy are then highlighted with recommendations on ways forward. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Marine hydrogen storage tanks are used differently than those used in the automobile industry because of the challenging sea conditions, which restrict their further use in ships. Current research is focused on finding ways to make marine hydrogen storage tanks stable and safe in these conditions. The use of hydrogen as a source of energy requires four main technologies: production, storage, transportation, and application. In this study, the fastening method for the hydrogen storage tank on the ship, node optimization, failure analysis, and real-time structural inspection of the connection node between the hydrogen storage tank and the ship are all covered. The failure processes and influencing variables of marine hydrogen storage tanks are distinct because in complex sea conditions, the fixed nodes of hydrogen storage tanks on ships are susceptible to hydrodynamic loads from waves and currents. The application of fiber optic nondestructive testing, digital twin technology, and intelligent sensing technology to the deteriorating performance and damage patterns of crucial ship connection nodes is covered in this study. It is anticipated that different technologies will combine to play a larger and larger role in the monitoring of ship life and the fatigue of hydrogen storage tank connecting nodes. The main challenges that marine hydrogen storage tanks face in complex sea conditions are summarized along with the current state of research. Suggestions are then made for the development of marine hydrogen storage tanks in the future, and a wide range of hydrogen energy applications are anticipated. © 2023",Digital twin technology; Fatigue failure; High pressure hydrogen storage tank; Impact failure; Intelligent sensing technology; Non-destructive testing technology; Optimal design,Automotive industry; Failure (mechanical); Fatigue of materials; Fuel cells; Fuel tanks; High pressure engineering; High temperature applications; Hydrogen storage; Marine applications; Ships; Digital twin technology; Fatigue failures; High pressure hydrogen storage tank; Impact failures; Intelligent sensing; Intelligent sensing technology; Non destructive testing; Non-destructive testing technology; Optimal design; Sensing technology; Testing technology; Nondestructive examination,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11602101, 12172158); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (2021RIS-004); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165351091

Digital twin (DT) can solve the above problems in piling construction because of their inherent three-dimensionality and real-time feedback. The present study proposes a system that utilizes the DT framework to construct a collision early warning system intended for marine piling. A five-dimensional model is used to introduce the overall architecture. The main twin objects are piles. To maximize the effectiveness of DT, the five-dimensional model is composed of four independently maintainable development modules. Consequently, a prototype of the system is created. The core of the system comprises an algorithm for pile positioning and an algorithm for collision early warning, especially for complex pile groups. Two distinct implementations are identified: one involves controlling the virtual with the real, while the other involves controlling the real with the virtual. Field experiments are conducted with the aim of establishing a benchmark for collision early warning during the construction process. The prototype of the system is capable of producing a simulated environment through a dual-layer mapping approach, which involves pile-boat mapping and early-warning feedback mapping. The presented system in a practical wharf project showcases both the capacity for three-dimensional visualization of collision warning and the ability to provide feedback for boat control.

The review defines digital twin in relation to structural integrity management as a virtual representation of a physical structure that mirrors the same structural conditions in real time. Twinning is a dynamic process that involves reducing the discrepancy between the virtual representation and physical structure, which is achieved with the aid of monitored data. Regarding the state-of-the-art concerning marine structure applications, all require the creation of a finite element model to represent the physical structure. Several practical schemes for physical to virtual interconnection have been proposed, but few researchers have concentrated on virtual to physical feedback. In addition, most works have focused only on assessing the current states of structures. To address this, a digital twin-based monitoring framework is proposed and three key enabling technologies, namely model updating, real-time simulation, and data-driven forecasting are demonstrated using a numerical case study. Such technologies enable structural diagnostics, as well as prognostics, to support decision making such as inspection/maintenance planning. Based on the case study, the opportunities and associated challenges of digital twin are discussed. For instance, to fully exploit the potential of digital twin, challenges related to monitoring systems such as standardisation, enhanced redundancy for long-term application, and monitored data quality assurance need to be addressed. Further, because digital twin can avail a vast amount of data, a dedicated data mining capability should also be incorporated. © IMechE 2024.",condition assessment; digital twin; Digitalisation; structural health monitoring; structural integrity management,Data mining; Decision making; Marine applications; Quality assurance; Structural integrity; Case-studies; Condition assessments; Critical review; Digitalization; Emerging technologies; Framework development; Integrity management; Physical structures; Structural integrity management; Virtual representations; Structural health monitoring,,Review,Article in press,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183892116

To ensure fitness-for-service of these critical assets, there has been increasing interest in the application of digital twin-enabled virtual monitoring techniques. Whilst numerous studies have focused on computational algorithms dedicated to virtual monitoring, little effort has been devoted to establishing a practical digital-to-physical connection and decision-making based on virtually monitored data. This paper bridges this research gap by proposing an approach for implementing digital twin-enabled virtually monitored data in inspection planning for marine structures. The inspection of fatigue-prone structural components plays a crucial role in structural integrity management. Reliability-informed inspection, which employs a probabilistic approach that prioritises inspections based on probability of failure, offers a cost-effective approach by avoiding unnecessary inspections and reducing life-cycle costs. However, conducting a comprehensive structural reliability analysis requires thorough knowledge of the actual operational profile and current state of a structure (e.g. consumed fatigue life) in order to accurately predict its future performance (e.g. remaining fatigue life). Although design specifications and assumptions can serve as guidelines, a high degree of uncertainty may arise due to the discrepancy between the actual operational profile and the design assumptions. The approach developed in this paper consists of four main elements: virtual monitoring, data-driven forecasting, fatigue reliability, and inspection planning. This provides a practical means for establishing a connection between condition monitoring and assessment in the digital world and decision-making in the physical world. An illustrative numerical example is then presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Finally, avenues for future research and developments in this field are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s)",Digital twin; Fatigue reliability; Inspection planning; Structural integrity; Structural monitoring,Condition monitoring; Cost effectiveness; Fatigue of materials; Inspection; Life cycle; Reliability analysis; Structural integrity; Cyclic waves; Decisions makings; Fatigue cracks; Fatigue reliability; Inspection planning; Ocean environment; Operational profile; Structural degradation; Structural monitoring; Wave load; crack propagation; cyclic loading; data set; fatigue; future prospect; life cycle analysis; prediction; virtual reality; wave-structure interaction; Decision making,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185155107

The production control in the loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs) involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing by 23.34% and 31.46% in small-scale and large-scale problems, respectively.

The benefit of network externality from smart technologies further enhances port operations when more users adopt smart technologies. However, network externality has rarely been studied in port operations before. In this paper, we formulate a game theoretical model to identify a port's optimal adoption strategy on smart technologies and analyze the impact of network externality on the port's pricing and adoption decisions. A utility-based model is developed to study the added value of smart technology and its network effect for port operations. The port has three possible strategies in smart technology adoption: no adoption, full adoption and hybrid adoption. We show that either strategy can be optimal depending on the costs, direct benefit and strength of network externality of smart technology. Particularly, our findings reveal a positive relationship between the strength of the network effect and the likelihood of adopting the smart technology. Additionally, as the network effect strengthens, the likelihood of the hybrid adoption being optimal also increases. In addition, ports with frequent congestion and delay problems are likely better off with hybrid adoption than full adoption due to the benefit of network effect.

The basic ways to construct the integrated monitoring system of marine environment and ecology in Beibu Gulf are as follows: integrating and adding marine multidisciplinary professional monitoring stations, transforming multi-system compatible marine buoy monitoring loads, establishing a regional marine monitoring linkage mechanism in the South China Sea, and building a big data platform for marine monitoring, forecasting and service visualization. Finally, the author makes a general outlook on the construction of intelligent marine engineering in Beibu Gulf, the construction of marine digital twin system in Beibu Gulf, the construction of integrated monitoring system for environmental and ecological regions in Beibu Gulf, and the future trend.

Despite its increasing importance, there is no standard definition of a smart port, resulting in each country having its own smart port development strategy. In this study, we explore how varied port governance of port authorities may impact the smart port development strategy. First, we established a set of evaluation criteria, using the Borda count and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, to obtain the key indicators for the development of smart ports in Taiwan. Then, we compared the preferred indicators of Taiwan’s smart port development strategy with those of Spanish ports. An obvious difference in this ranking comparison is found. This indicates that Taiwan’s strategy focuses on optimizing maritime safety, while Spain’s strategy focuses on improving operational economics. Finally, we analyzed the differences between the smart port development strategies of these two countries using the latest port governance classification table. The results of the above analysis are also verified by comparing the differences in port legislation between them. It turns out that the private sector is deeply involved in the operation of ports in Taiwan compared with Spain. Our main contribution lies in providing a clear pathway for developing a smart port in Taiwan in the future and investigating the reasons for different smart port development strategies in different countries. © 2022 by the authors.",evaluation indicators; FAHP; port development strategy; port governance; smart port; Spanish ports; Taiwanese ports,Spain; Taiwan; artificial intelligence; automation; competition (economics); development strategy; fuzzy mathematics; governance approach; legislation; optimization; port; private sector; technological development,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137203998

However, there are major challenges to efficiently build and update the DT-based simulation system and provide simulation as a service (SimaaS): 1) virtualization machine based heavyweight methods to create simulation environments for DT models consume too much resource and time; 2) DT-based simulation systems in the cloud or developers' desktops could not well support the real-time response and synchronize with the physical counterparts at the edge of the network. Therefore, a methodology of container virtualization based simulation as a service (CVSimaaS) is put forward to utilize lightweight containers to realize convenient DT system deployment and less resource consumption with high efficiency. Then a device-edge-cloud system architecture with a formal process are proposed to support the CVSimaaS paradigm. A matrix based management and scheduling model for computing infrastructure, container images and services is established to support the efficient CVSimaaS process. Finally, the methodology is applied to building a DT-based simulation system for intelligent manufacturing. The results show that the DT-based simulation system can be 1) easily deployed to heterogeneous infrastructure and terminals at the cloud, edge and device, and 2) parallelly scheduled and operated on high performance cloud/edge on demand for large-scale online analysis.

In two-stroke uniflow scavenging marine engines, a real-time physical model for the scavenging process is rarely found since it is difficult to describe the complex in-cylinder air motion. Without an accurate prediction of the fresh air loss and residual burned gas in the cylinder, the precision of combustion and emission simulation cannot be guaranteed as well. In a marine engine digital twin system, the scavenging ratio and fresh air skip are the vital for the further simulation of combustion and emission. To predict them in real-time, a novel zero-dimensional (0D) multi-stage scavenging model is proposed in this article. In the cylinder zone, the complex gas motion is ideally divided to four stages: exhaust gas blowdown, perfect displacement, displacement-mixing, and perfect mixing. The duration of each stage is determined by the engine design and control parameters. Then, the thermodynamic conditions at each stage are simulated to obtain the mass of residual burned gas, fresh air inlet, and outlet. The results of the 0D model agree well with the results of the CFD simulation, and the mean relative errors of temperature, pressure, and total mass do not exceed 3%, 4%, and 2%, respectively, which indicates the potential for the two-stroke marine engine digital twin system. It could also be applied in a control-oriental engine model or engine diagnostics in the future.

However, the existing performance evaluation system for port information systems represents a research gap. It cannot effectively achieve specific improvement in the construction of information systems for port services and capabilities. In this paper, an evaluation index system was forged from the three perspectives of the operating level, management capability, and economic efficiency. As a first step, starting from the current situation of Beibu Gulf Port (Port B) construction, the three dimensions of the evaluation index system were determined using the scheme of literature review, questionnaire research, and fieldwork. Additionally, through adversarial interpretive structural modeling (AISM), it is concluded that the port loading and unloading operation capability and service level are the fundamental factors for measuring the construction performance of the container terminal operation system (CTOS). The results are used as input to construct an analytic network process (ANP) model to obtain the index weights. Finally, the gray clustering method (GCM) is introduced to construct a quantitative evaluation model to quantitatively evaluate the construction performance of the Port B CTOS. The quantitative benefits brought by the construction of the CTOS are finally verified. The scores of the corresponding dimensions of the port before and after the construction of the CTOS system in Beibu Gulf Port are obtained experimentally. The conclusion shows that the construction of CTOS makes the port operating level module improve the most, from 40.023 to 70.733 points; at the same time, it is found that two aspects, i.e., green security and economic benefits, in current construction are directions requiring further work in future port construction.

Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model's security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system's multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and 0.01∼ 0.05λ value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",Digital twins; Internet of Things; maritime silk road; maritime transportation system; relay cooperation,Data communication systems; Data transfer; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Outages; Probability; Roads and streets; Silk; Marine vehicles; Maritime silk road.; Maritime transportation; Maritime transportation system; Radiofrequencies; Relay; Relay cooperation; Security; Security performance; Silk roads; Internet of things,"Key and Development Plan-Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province, (2019JZZY020101); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61873341, 61902203, 62171330); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province, (2020BAB102)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120537831

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its rapid global spread have caused significant port congestion, resulting in skyrocketing freight rates and posing a serious threat to the smooth operation of international trade. Based on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a novel container port congestion evaluation model by integrating the classical SEIR model, using the system dynamics (SD) theory. In this study, we simulate the impact of different port congestion countermeasures using data from Ningbo Zhoushan Port. The results demonstrate that implementing smart regulations at a high level of epidemic prevention and control is the most efficient approach to swiftly eliminate port congestion. In addition, it is worth mentioning that in the scenarios with a low level of epidemic prevention and control, increasing port investment to optimize smart ports can yield even better effects. Furthermore, we have discussed the impact of factors such as the ratio of infected people, the number of contacted people, and epidemic prevention and control capacity on port congestion index. Hence, we propose that the implementation of advanced smart regulation systems can enhance port operational efficiency and effectively alleviate port congestion. Additionally, amidst the normalization of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has yet to disappear, it is crucial to maintain a vigilant approach to prevention and control to ensure the seamless operation of the port industry. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Maritime transportation; Pandemic; Port congestion; SEIR model; System dynamics,International trade; Supply chains; System theory; Global consumption; Global production; Maritime supply chain; Maritime transportation; Pandemic; Port congestion; Prevention and controls; Production and consumption; SEIR model; System Dynamics; COVID-19,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (22AGL020)",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166479507

Structural integrity is a high priority during asset design and operation to preserve human safety, environment protection, and to maintain operations. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), a process of deriving the health status and predicting structural damage via sensor-based measurements, data trending and analysis, has been commonly implemented in marine and offshore assets for decades. There are mature commercial SHM products on the market and available international and industrial regulations, guidance and classification rules (such as IMO MSC/ Circ. 646, ABS Guide for Hull Condition Monitoring Systems, etc.). With the emergence of the Structural Digital Twin (SDT) concept in the marine industry in the recent years, the application of structural sensors on marine structures and the integration between sensor-based SHM techniques and structural digital twin approaches have attracted more attention. As a digital representation of the physical asset, the structural digital twin typically involves multiple-scale, multiple-physics, and data driven models and simulations. Leveraging the high fidelity full-scale SHM data, the structural digital twin is capable to provide more accurate assessments, predictions, and insights on structural integrity conditions and support the decision-making process regarding asset operation, structural inspection, repairs, and condition-based asset integrity management. This paper reviews the mature and commonly employed SHM sensor techniques (such as electric resistance strain gauge, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain gauge, accelerometer, pressure transducer, etc.) and discusses their implementation on marine assets and integration with structural digital twin. The paper elaborates to provide some general guidance on the selection of the structural sensors and their installation, as well as the proper sensor specification, in the context of a structural digital twin implementation. The paper also discusses the required engineering mindsets and skillsets for developing and deploying sensor plans, and for implementing a sensor-based structural digital twin framework. The paper concludes that a successful SHM plan and structural digital twin implementation rely on sensor planning, data acquisition, data processing, analytic models and a proper integration of the data and data analytics. The overall planning and implementation should be governed by the suitability for the business purpose and implementation expectation.

Offshore wind farms, in particular, have emerged as a crucial source of renewable energy, owing to their benefits such as no land occupation and abundant resources. However, the design, installation, operation, and maintenance (O&M) of floating wind turbines (FWTs) involve multiple sources of heterogeneous data, which pose challenges to data integration and management, as well as to the simulation and analysis of FWTs. To address this issue, this study proposes a unified framework based on digital twin (DT) to acquire and integrate diverse types of information used throughout the entire life cycle of FWTs. A digital 3D model serves as a medium to enable real-time synchronization and inversion of sensor data, facilitating the simulation and analysis of the global state of FWTs. The proposed framework is evaluated through a case study of a twin-barge float-over project, which includes process simulation, mechanical analysis, and anomaly identification. The results demonstrate that DT can facilitate timely monitoring and analysis of FWTs, and enable visualization of construction plans, early warning of structural abnormalities, and accurate recognition of FWT posture and marine environment.

Digital twin simulators for complex dynamic operation systems such as shipboard cranes, allow the operators to practice demanding operations in a risk-free immersive environment with various scenarios. This paper presents the process of developing a digital twin-based simulation tool designed for shipboard crane operations. It is based on co-simulation using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard. This allows for the integration of the operation scenarios with different physical domain models, including such as the ship, environmental forces, hydraulic power systems, and controllers. In addition, the digital twin has opened up new opportunities for the optimization of maritime systems. It can be used to identify the optimal operating conditions, predict potential risks, and provide onboard support to the operator.

We first construct a knowledge graph for operational processes in container terminals, employing a tailored procedure for the automatic conversion of operational records into triples. By utilising the graph information, we propose a novel method that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with a mathematical solver for optimising scheduling problems. The quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP) is illustrated as an example to elaborate on the technical details.

What is the sea state given a certain wave height, wave directional spreading, and wind speed (e.g., 2 m, 29°, 18 m/s)? An expert user might be able to imagine the sea conditions with such information, but this will be almost impossible for a non-expert user. The common approach for visualizing oceanographic data and its variability is usually through tables and 2D graphs, for example plots, bar diagrams, and latitude-longitude maps. These visualizations are often limited to displaying raw data values, which still require user interpretation.

The open-source application represents in a realistic and intuitive way the observations from a meteo-oceanographic and seafloor observatory located in the Western Mediterranean; the OBSEA observatory.

The allowable axial tension is compared with the loads expected during operation to establish safe operating limits. The digital twin is divided into a local model and a global model. The local analysis uses a finite element model to investigate how stresses on tensile armor wires change when the number of broken wires increases. It considers all pipe layers and two configurations, 1) straight and 2) with a curvature expected during the recovery operation. The FPSO motion performance is calibrated by offshore field measurements and improved RAOs for the global analysis are provided based on the measured motions. Finally, the allowable axial load from the local analysis is compared with the expected loads from the global analysis. The local model is simulated stepwise with 0-28 broken wires and indicated a reduction of 83% in allowable axial load with 25 broken wires. The results were combined with global simulations considering different sea states to provide insights about how close the loads might be to the allowable limit during operation and what loads the riser was subjected to since the last broken wires were detected. This analysis allowed the identification of the most critical steps in operation and helped to design the procedure to achieve ALARP risks.

Inspired by Foucault's work, connectivity is here understood as an outcome of governance, the result of the strategic combination of practices of power that presupposes agency. The connectivity that ports afford constitutes a rich empirical space from which to interrogate how global and regional spaces such as Europe are actively constituted. The analytical challenge, however, is how to render port connectivity as an empirical site. The metaphor of knots is explored in this article as a way to explore how port governance as the result of actively combining disparate interests into a coherent whole provides such a site.

Searching for the optimal AGV scheduling and routing plan are effective and efficient ways to improve its efficiency and reduce its cost. However, uncertainties in the physical environment of ACT can make it challenging to determine the optimal scheduling and routing plan. This paper presents the digital-twin-driven AGV scheduling and routing framework, aiming to deal with uncertainties in ACT. By introducing the digital twin, uncertain factors can be detected and handled through the interaction and fusion of physical and virtual spaces. The improved artificial fish swarm algorithm Dijkstra (IAFSA-Dijkstra) is proposed for the optimal AGV scheduling and routing solution, which will be verified in the virtual space and further fed back to the real world to guide actual AGV transport. Then, a twin-data-driven conflict prediction method is proposed to predict potential conflicts by constantly comparing the differences between physical and virtual ACT. Further, a conflict resolution method based on the Yen algorithm is explored to resolve predicted conflicts and drive the evolution of the scheme.

In the majority of cases, the water-wave problem is reduced to potential flow theory on a somehow simplified level. However, the nonlinear terms in the surface boundary conditions and the fact that they must be fulfilled on the unknown water surface make the boundary value problem considerably complex. Hereby, the contrary objectives with respect to a very accurate representation of reality and numerical efficiency must be balanced wisely. This paper investigates the influence of characteristic sea state parameters on the accuracy of irregular wave field simulations of different complexity. For this purpose, the high-order spectral method was applied and the underlying Taylor series expansion was truncated at different orders so that numerical simulations of different complexity can be investigated.

This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 × 200 × 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information.

The stability of the system and the safety of the inverter are at risk, though, because there is no central controller for monitoring the activities of the generator set. As a result, under the influence of potential network attacks, the control decisions between distributed generations (DGs) will be directly destroyed, and the power sharing between DGs will be hampered. To address the secondary control problem of the microgrid under false data injection (FDI) attacks, inspired by the concept of Digital Twins, this study proposes a virtual network defined by cloud network technology or software and linked to the microgrid's distributed cooperative control algorithm, to achieve frequency (voltage) synchronization and power sharing of SMGs. © 2023 IEEE.",distributed consensus algorithm; network attacks; Seaport microgrids,Microgrids; System stability; Virtual addresses; Consensus algorithms; Control strategies; Distributed consensus; Distributed consensus algorithm; Distributed-control; False data injection attacks; Microgrid; Network attack; Power sharing; Seaport microgrid; Distributed parameter control systems,"S&T Program of Hebei, (216Z1601G, 226Z4501G); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (F2021203075, F2023203099); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U23A20333, 62122065, 62373320); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Department of Education of Hebei Province, (JZX2024005); Department of Education of Hebei Province; Iconic Special Cultivation Project of Yanshan University, (2022BZZD006); Provincial Key Laboratory Performance Subsidy Project, (22567612H)",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191021169

To solve the developed model, a two-stage solution method based on dynamic programming and branch-and-bound algorithms is developed. The solution approach is applied to 41 real-sized problem instances. Our experiments revealed that the proposed method outperforms CPLEX by accurately solving the problem instances in a reasonable time.

The characteristics of the maritime industry DT models are discussed in terms of target system, research contribution and simulation method. In addition, DT in the context of product life-cycle perspective in the maritime industry is analyzed and discussed in terms of design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases. Based on our analysis and discussion of the research, we found that the current DT research in the maritime sector is mainly focused on relatively small modules, or small systems, or even only on individual components. In addition, only a small fraction of the reviewed DT-related papers focuses on the whole life-cycle in the maritime industry. The reason may come from that the models and sub-models are not yet flexible and adaptive enough at different life-cycle stages. Therefore, we believe that the development of DT technology is still in the developmental stage in the maritime industry. © 2023 IEEE.",digital twin; maritime industry; product life-cycle,Marine engineering; Marine industry; Product design; Classifieds; Life cycle perspectives; Manufacturing operations; Maritime industry; Product life cycles; Research characteristics; Research object; Systems research; Target systems; Underwater vehicles; Life cycle,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85179507531

Full autonomy could be obtained by two linked Artificial-Intelligence systems representing the ship navigator and the ship engineer that possess sensing and analysis skills, situational awareness, planning, and control capabilities. Many efforts have been made in developing onboard systems; however, the shore facilities are not ready yet to deal with these new technologies. The paper aims to present the innovative technologies and methodologies needed to develop a futuristic Vessel Traffic System. The proposed systems will aim at faultless data acquisition and processing, provide input to decision-making systems, and suggest evasive manoeuvre; to deal with hazards and systems failure without human intervention onboard. The system is composed of three different and interacting layers. The first is an artificially intelligent tool to detect and control autonomous ships, thanks to situation recognition and obstacle avoidance strategies. The second is an orchestration and management platform designed to coordinate the sensing/actuation infrastructure and the AI algorithms' results made available by multiple ships, mustering edge, and distributed computing techniques to fulfil the specific harsh requirements of the sea environment. The final part is a holistic guidance-navigation-control framework to manage autonomous ships' navigation in a crowded area.

This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships. © 2022 The Author(s)",Digital transition; Digital twin; Industry 4.0; Literature review; Ship life-cycle,Electronic data interchange; Industry 4.0; Ships; Virtual reality; Complex objects; Digital transition; Literature reviews; Manufacturing IS; Model-based systems; Ship life-cycle; Shipping industry; Ships lives; Systematic Review; Virtual models; correlation; critical analysis; life cycle analysis; literature review; ship design; Life cycle,"European Commission, EC",Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145283461

It is imperative that our nation and our industry partners evaluate and develop port protection systems that utilize, and defend against, autonomous underwater vehicle threats of the future. This paper reviews the problem of port protection, its importance, technical challenges, and existing and novel technology that may support the required protection functions. A literature review outlines the history of port security capabilities, both supporting and adversarial systems, including underwater vehicles and marine mammals. Assumptions, variable definitions, and methodology for evaluating port protection scenarios are presented. A port protection solution is introduced with corresponding evaluation strategies and potential technologies for implementation.

In order to determine asset health, high fidelity, multi-modal data is captured remotely using robotics, and subsequently analyzed. This facilitates the production of prioritized actionable insights to be produced. These insights can be scheduled as maintenance works. This paper outlines a novel multimodal inspection system that was deployed at a port to facilitate its remote inspection. Two inspections are detailed in this paper, with differing inspection requirements and constraints. The inspection operation can be broken down into multiple components, an underwater scan of the port, a water-surface scan, a ground level scan and an aerial scan. The Port Asset required the inspection of the wharf and quay walls. The Marine Terminal Asset required inspection of the complex pipework. The data collected from the different modalities were represented in the 3D space. The alignment of the different modalities could then be done in this representation. For the Port Asset, where multibeam sonar maps were collected, the difficulty in alignment of the different modalities is apparent due to no shared points below and under-water, which requires estimation using extended features as landmarks. There also exists slight warping between the data that must need localized scaling for certain sections, which may be done using local submaps and scaling. For the Marine Terminal Asset, artificial markers are used to allow scaling of the drone captured photogrammetry. High levels of coverage from the multiple views of the asset from different data collection strategies allowed the complex pipework to be well mapped, with further insights from the co-registered imagery. The novel information described in this paper is the unique combination of different modalities for a broadscale port inspection, with point clouds from sonar, lidar, photogrammetry and imagery, in a combined reference frame which acts as a digital twin for the port. This also allows unique insights, such as the exact context and magnitude of faults in the port environment, to allow corrective works to be targeted correctly.

Therefore, the interest in introducing autonomous surface vessels, particularly in the commercial sector, is receiving increasing attention. Digital twins, virtual representations of physics assets or processes enabled through data and models for real-time control, optimization, monitoring, and informed decision-making, are seen as key enablers for autonomy. Based on their capability, a digital twin is generally categorized on a scale from 0-5 (0-standalone, 1-descriptive, 2-diagnostic, 3-predictive, 4-prescriptive, 5-autonomous). The current work aims at concretizing the categorization in the context of autonomous vessels. It demonstrates some capability levels by introducing the development of an extendable digital twin framework created in the Unity game engine using physics-based models and real-time data. For this purpose, real-time weather and automatic identification system (AIS) data is streamed. While computer-aided design (CAD) and a three-dimensional (3D) height map build the foundation of a standalone digital twin, real-time data, physics-based models, and synthetic sensors set the basis of descriptive representations. Finally, an environmental disturbance observer enables the first diagnostic abilities, while a reinforcement learning algorithm pushes towards autonomous capabilities. It is argued that the work will improve the overall situational awareness for safe sea operations. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

As the maritime industry pivots to the use of alternate low and zero-emission fuels to adapt to a changing regulatory landscape, hydrogen energy needs to present and substantiate a technical and commercially viable use case to secure its value proposition in the future fuel mix. This paper leverages the technoeconomic and environmental assessment previously performed on HyForce, a hydrogen-fuelled harbour tug which has shown encouraging results for both technical and commercial aspects. This study aims to create a digital twin of HyForce to accurately predict her operability in real-world scenarios. The results from this study identify the strengths and drawbacks of the proposed use case. This is achieved by embedding the detailed design of HyForce in a virtual environment to further evaluate its operational performance through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of realistic environmental conditions such as wind, wave, sea currents, and friction attributed to the properties of seawater. The results from this study indicate a base case power requirement of 93 kW to 1892 kW to achieve speeds of 5 to 12 knots in the absence of external environmental influences. Consequently, the speed of HyForce has a profound impact on total resistance peaking at 97.3 kN at 12 knots. Seawater properties such as low seawater temperature of 0 °C, and a high salinity of 50 g/kg increased friction. Additionally, wind speeds of 10 m/s acting on HyForce, delivered a resistance of 3 kN. However, these will be well mitigated through the design of the propulsion system which will be able to deliver a thrust power of 1892 kW and with assistance from the energy storage systems produce 2 MW of power to overcome the resistance experienced. The findings presented in this paper can serve as a foundation for constructing a robust model for the development of a predictive controller for future work. This controller has the potential to optimize the configuration of hydrogen and battery energy storage, aligning with desired cost functions. © 2024 The Authors",Hydrogen fuel cell; Hydrogen propulsion; Hydrogen tug; Operational planning; Vessel powertrain modelling; Vessel resistance,Computational fluid dynamics; Cost functions; Energy management systems; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Marine applications; Marine engineering; Seawater; Ship propulsion; Hydrogen fuel cells; Hydrogen propulsion; Hydrogen tug; Hydrogen-fuelled; Operational planning; Power; Powertrain models; Property; Vessel powertrain modeling; Vessel's resistance; Friction,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB; RIE2025 Industry Alignment Fund; IAF-ICP, (I2101E0003)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195514058

Despite this, BSR ports are of a colossal importance for the regional economic development serving as gateways for the individual regions and drivers of socio-economic and environmental transition. In addition, ports are essential in pursuing new innovation avenues.

A successful environmental and digital transformation going hand in hand in SMSPs enable sustainable boost of sustainable development. Thus, as a first step, the assessment of sustainable readiness in SMSPs is incumbent in order to implement tailor-made solutions on individual basis, by ensuring efficient usage of available resources and capabilities. In line with the Connect2SmallPorts project, part-financed by the INTERREG South Baltic Programme, 38 SMSPs in the BSR were approached to mapping their digital readiness according to the methodology of the Digital Readiness Index for Ports (DRIP), published within the project in 2020.

This work presents the concept of applying a Performance Digital Twin for monitoring the technical condition and diagnosing malfunctions of marine ICE, along with its implementation on an experimental test-bench, based on a marine diesel-generator. The main principles of implementing this concept involve data transmission technologies, from the sensors installed on the engine to a server. The Digital Twin, also operating on the server, is used to automatically process the acquired experimental data, accumulate statistics, determine the current technical state of the engine, identify possible malfunctions, and make decisions regarding changes in operating programs. The core element of the Digital Twin is a mathematical model of the marine diesel engine's operating cycle. In its development, significant attention was devoted to refining the fuel combustion model, as the combustion processes significantly impact both the engine's fuel efficiency and the level of toxic emissions of exhaust gases. The enhanced model differs from the base model, by considering the variable value of the average droplets' diameter during fuel injection. This influence on fuel vapourisation, combustion, and the formation of toxic components is substantial, as shown. Using the example of calibrating the model to the test results of a diesel engine under 27 operating modes, it is demonstrated that the application of the improved combustion model allows better adjustment of the Digital Twin to experimental data, thus achieving a more accurate correspondence to a real engine.  © 2023 Dmytro Minchev et al., published by Sciendo.",combustion model; diagnostics; digital twin; marine diesel engine,Diesel engines; Efficiency; Exhaust gases; Marine applications; Marine engines; Combustion model; Diagnostic; Diesel engine applications; Experimental test benches; Marine diesel; Marine Diesel Engines; Performance; Power plant operations; Technical conditions; Test-bench; Combustion,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180404710

Keeping track of the structural fatigue, integrity, and reliability renders benefits to these platforms such as enabling predictive maintenance and risk-based decision support. While computational techniques are useful in providing insights to deepen our understanding of the physics involved, these are resource-intensive and not suited for predictive capabilities. Here we introduce an effective deep learning method based on Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) to predict unsteady hydrodynamic forces on jack-up legs, which are mainly governed by non-linear drag forces, as well as dynamic responses of the jack-up in terms of reaction forces and hull motion. The numerical OF-ABAQUS solver (one-way fluid-structure coupling) designed for jack-up by Li et al. (2022, 2023) is used to generate a database for the deep neural network, which takes in wave elevation time series as the input. A leaky non-linear rectification is used to trace the relationship between wave elevation (as the input) and hydrodynamic forces as well as structural responses (as the outputs). The LSTM model is trained using a stochastic gradient descent method, and the results are compared with the full-order numerical simulations. Once the hyper-parameters of the LSTM algorithm are identified, further tuning for each sea-state is not required. Instead, the same LSTM algorithm can be used for different sea-states. The predictions made with our LSTM model are real-time, 96,000 times faster than the full-order simulations, within a 6% error threshold, and use a negligible amount of central processing unit (CPU) power. This powerful tool can be used to obtain real-time predictions using computers on offshore platforms without high-performance computers inland. Further, the proposed LSTM-based method can be applied to create digital twins for jack-up platforms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Computational fluid dynamics; Finite element analysis; Jack-up; Long short time memory (LSTM); Machine learning,Computational fluid dynamics; Deep neural networks; Drag; Drilling platforms; Dynamic response; Forecasting; Gradient methods; Hydrodynamics; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Numerical methods; Ocean currents; Offshore oil well production; Program processors; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Finite element analyse; Hydrodynamic forces; Jack-up; Jack-up platform; Long short time memory; Machine-learning; Memory modeling; Off shore platforms; Real-time prediction; Wave elevations; algorithm; computational fluid dynamics; dynamic response; fatigue; finite element method; hydrodynamic force; hydrodynamics; jack up platform; machine learning; real time; Finite element method,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (A19F1a0104); Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192825518

A leaky non-linear rectification is employed to approximate the mapping between surface elevation time series and hydrodynamic (drag) force time series. The deep neural network is fed with irregular waves based on JONSWAP spectrum as the input and the target data generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations using a generic offshore jack-up platform.

High-performing ports are implementing smart technologies to better manage operations meeting new challenges in maintaining safe, secure, and energy efficient facilities that mitigate environmental impacts. In this context, a new concept has emerged which is called smart port. However, a unified definition of a smart port has not been well documented. This article attempts to develop a framework for a smart port and a quantitative metric, smart port index (SPI), that ports can use to improve their resiliency and sustainability. Our proposed SPI is based on key performance indicators (KPIs) gathered from the literature. These KPIs are organized around four key activity domains of a smart port: operations, environment, energy, and safety & security. Case studies are conducted to show how one can use SPI and to assess the performance of some of the busiest ports in the world. Our methodology provides a quantitative tool for port authorities to develop their smart port strategies, assess their smartness, and identify strengths and weaknesses of their current operations for continuous improvement. Our study reveals that smart port initiatives around the world have different levels of comprehensiveness. The results of this study also suggest that government policies and region-specific variables can impact SPI value. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",key performance indicators; maritime transportation; resilience; Smart port index; sustainability,Benchmarking; Competition; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Sustainable development; Waterway transportation; Continuous improvements; Energy efficient facilities; Key performance indicators; Maritime transportation; Quantitative metric; Quantitative tool; resilience; Smart port index; competition (economics); governance approach; harbor; infrastructural development; maritime transportation; performance assessment; port development; port operation; quantitative analysis; transportation planning; transportation technology; Ports and harbors,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065782662

We focus on demonstrating how a set of Smart Port Index (SPI) metrics can be incorporated into the port microgrid planning process in the proposed framework to holistically improve the smartness of the port. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model is developed to explain how the use of microgrid at a port can effectively enhance the port's performance in four key activity domains: operations, environment, energy, safety and security under operation uncertainty. The proposed model consists of an investment master problem on the first stage and a multi-objective operation planning subproblem on the second stage. Benders decomposition is implemented for solving the two-stage stochastic model, and Lexicographic Goal Programming is applied to the subproblem to deal with multiple objectives.

The off-design in small and mid-sized power generation and pumping gas turbine units is caused by the present grid demands, different ambient conditions, etc. In turn, aircraft and marine propulsion GTEs off-design are caused by variations in operation regime. Off-design/part load conditions influence not only the gas turbine efficiency but also its reliable operation, in particular, the hot gas path parts and compressor’s margin to surge. The development of a flexible, fast and high fidelity approach of GTU part-load and off-design performance prediction is of vital importance with the capability to analyze all the parameters of a compressor, turbine and cooling system. The objective of the presented study is to elaborate on such an approach. In this paper, the concept of digital twin to predict off-design GTU performance is utilized. Digital twin, or a specially organized collection of physics-based methods/modules, was created for the power generation unit-166MW GTU prototype.

"Mullison, J; Wanis, P; Symonds, D","Mullison, Jerry; Wanis, Paul; Symonds, Darryl",,Field Testing of a New ADCP,,"2011 IEEE/OES/CWTM TENTH WORKING CONFERENCE ON CURRENT, WAVES AND TURBULENCE MEASUREMENT (CWTM)",0,106,View Full Record in Web of Science,"Since its introduction in 1992, the Teledyne RDI Instruments (TRDI) Workhorse ADCP has become ubiquitous, with literally thousands of systems deployed in nearly every body of water on earth. While the measurement itself remains relatively unchanged, in the intervening years the use of the measurements has changed to an extraordinary extent. Originally a novel way to measure currents sorely in need of proving and acceptance by the research community, ADCP measurements are now the de facto standard for current measurement. What began as a useful tool for academic research continues in that role, but has also become standard equipment for real time decision making. ADCPs are now routinely used to measure river discharge and to aid flood control engineers in managing river levels. Since a terrible accident occurred in Tampa Bay, ADCPs now provide current information in near real-time to the pilots and captains of large vessels as they ply many of the world's major ports and waterways. Because offshore platforms cannot safely operate in the large currents of the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current and the Eddies it generates, ADCPs play a critical role on all offshore platforms in the deep Gulf of Mexico. The presence and trajectories of these high Gulf of Mexico currents are forecast with great accuracy, the ADCPs real utility comes in determining when they are no longer affecting the rig. ADCPs provide information on an hourly basis in near real time from the TAO/TRITON array for climate forecasting. Returned Signal Strength Intensity data, originally provided strictly as an ancillary quality control parameter, has developed into a useful tool for studies as diverse as the diel migration of zooplankton to aid in creating optimal harbor designs based on sediment transport patterns in the area. The way that ADCPs are deployed has also changed dramatically. Originally a speed log for large vessels, the ADCP first morphed to a large, and very heavy, instrument for autonomous deployments on moorings. It has grown smaller and lighter over the years, with some ADCPs now easily hand carried from location to location for spot measurements. ADCPs are now available in horizontal configurations, with multiple beams, even as single point current meters. Perhaps most dramatic of all is the change in the typical user of ADCP data. The original early adopters of ADCP technology were members of the academic community well versed in marine engineering, computer programming and underwater acoustics in addition to their main interest of measuring ocean currents. Those users are still around of course, but they are now the minority. The typical user of today has less interest in how the measurement was made than in the robustness, accuracy and general utility of the current measurement for their purpose at hand. That is, the instrument is a given, the information it provides is what is needed. Many users are now no longer nearly as familiar with DOS and Unix (if at all) as they are with smart phones and touch screens. TRDI has been developing a new ADCP with these changes in mind. A prototype of the new system was deployed along with a Workhorse used as a standard for comparison. We present the results of that deployment, and some of the changes made in light of the changing requirements of the users.",ADCP; Sentinel V; Monitor V,,,Conference paper,,,,

In the information era, we are literally swimming in an ocean of structured and not structured data and thanks to the evolution in the communications technologies, all that data are available everywhere for everyone. But data is not information. It is necessary to have the capability to analyse, extract conclusions and learn from it. Technologies as Big Data (BD) and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) are crucial for this purpose, but the intention of the treatment matters. Imagine how these technologies shall allow to engage the ship design by applying rules which will facilitate the design significantly, how the integration of the validation of the structural models by the Classification Societies will be linked directly by cloud applications. Imagine all the benefits of this two simple examples that can be implemented thanks to the potential of these technologies. The concepts that are absolutely clear from now to the future in shipbuilding is the use of Data Centric model and the concept of Digital Twin, a real and effective synchronization between what we design, what we construct, by covering the complete life cycle of the product thanks to technologies like loT. It is important to understand how the new generations are immersed in a technological world in constant and rapid evolution. The way they interacts with this ecosystem will determine the way we should define the new rules of the CAD/CAM/CIM Systems.

It is conspicuous that among Industry 4.0, the digital ship has become a necessity. To achieve this goal in the short term, the marine industry must embrace a digital transformation from design to operation phases, a genuine and not trivial challenge. Starting with design, the industry is gently adopting new procedures. Traditional design processes will not be enough in a short future, being necessary to incorporate technologies such as Artificial Intelligence or analytics to all stages of design. Continuing with construction phases, the naval industry must incorporate tools such as Virtual Reality and Smart classification processes in order to achieve the best results and maintain traceability of the project. Finally, regarding operation, IoT connectivity for real time analysis, combined with analytics will provide the renowned term of Digital Twins. In all these phases, making a digital twin a reality today must face many challenges for different reasons.

The pandemic and the disruption of traditional supply chains are forcing companies to change their production geography. Accelerated digitization of people's and companies' livelihoods is contributing to the transformation of classical logistics, and in the end, those players who create an environment of additional services for delivery support, thereby forming resilience to risks, are winning. In this regard, there is a need to develop theoretical and applied aspects of the transition of port logistics to sustainable development through the introduction of smart port technologies that contribute to the achievement of a number of sustainable development goals, such as: 1: no poverty, 2: zero hunger, 3: good health and well-being, 8: decent work and economic growth, 9: industry innovation and infrastructure, 11: sustainable cities and communities, 12: responsible consumption and production, 13: climate action, 14: life below water, 17: partnerships for sustainable development. The theoretical basis of the research was scientific works of scholars from different countries and periods in the field of logistics, sustainable development, individual provisions of international framework documents, including the UN Conference on Environment and Development's Agenda for the 21st Century, the Declaration on Environ-mental Protection, and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development. Official data from the ports of Gdansk, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), the World Ports Climate Initiative (WPCI), the World Bank, and the Administration of Seaports of Ukraine (USPA) were used as initial information for analysis and concluding. As a result of summarizing the theoretical and methodological foundations of logistics, the article proposes the Conceptual Model of the Subject Area 'Smart Port', the quintessence of which lies in the symbiosis of the paradigms of scientific and technical development and sustainable development. This made it possible to expand the existing scientific basis of the transport logistics and transport systems sphere. The prerequisites for the emergence of the smart port are analyzed. The leading container ports of different generations are grouped. Special focus is on Ukraine, one of the largest grain exporters in the World. The prospects for the transition of Ukrainian ports to the fourth category (generation) of development are outlined. To successfully implement the strategy for the development of Ukrainian seaports for the period up to 2038, an optimization management model for logistics processes was developed based on the concept of a gaming approach. © 2023, Politechnika Lubelska.

GE Oil & Gas has addressed these challenges by creating a digital model of a physical asset, called a digital twin, which can then be optimized to drive enhanced business outcomes. In this instance, both a physical and a virtual model of a marine driller riser was created with the goal of reducing downtime or optimized inspection schedules of these critical assets, which can extend miles in length below the ocean's surface. The digital twin allows GE Oil & Gas to provide the driller with data-based diagnostics and insights into what is happening to the asset during a regular day or even during an extreme event, and then pick the most optimal way to run that asset. This marine riser digital twin will allow operators to maintain equipment in a more efficient manner. It can help reduce excessive maintenance and costs of the main tube for drilling contractors with a data-driven approach. The digital twin, or machine learning model, is a virtual model of the riser that is continuously updated against the sensor measurements and metocean conditions. When this data is beyond the original training conditions, a model retraining is automatically triggered. Visualization and alerts are provided by software, which ingests and performs advanced analytics on the field data enhance the operational decision-making for the drillers and operators. This continuous learning and update of the digital twin model allows us to provide more precise calculation of the riser fatigue life and enable optimizing operations in near real-time.",,drilling rig; extreme event; offshore structure; oil industry; operations technology; optimization; riser; sensor; visualization,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018324202

Digital twins are seen as important drivers of the digitalization in seaports by providing a basis for higher transparency, control and data-driven decision making. In this context, however, the concept is rarely studied, and implementation issues are not comprehensively discussed. The paper presents an exploratory study of digital twins in seaports based on a literature review and case studies. The analysis reveals a standardization deficit for digital twin implementations, an inflationary and improper use of the term digital twin, and fields of research that need to be explored further. The application of optimization methods and the integration of simulation-based optimization in the field of seaports and container terminals is examined, due to its relevance for digital twins. Important lessons learned can be taken from the most advanced implementations, integrating simulations and emulations with optimization methods.

Developing a fully automatic GTSU, however, presents a unique challenge: the system must autonomously determine the position of the cargo hold and the coordinates of the working point and identify potential hazards during material loading and unloading. This paper proposes AI models designed to detect cargo holds, extract working points, and support collision risk warnings, utilizing both the LiDAR sensor and the camera in the GTSU system. The model for cargo hold detection and collision warning was developed using image data of the cargo hold and grab, employing the You Only Look Once model. Concurrently, the model responsible for extracting the coordinates of working points for the GTSU system was designed by integrating the cargo hold detection and point cloud processing models. After testing the AI models for the lab-scale GTSU, the results show that the cargo hold detection and collision warning models achieve an accuracy of approximately 96% and 90%, respectively. Additionally, the working point coordinates extracted from the sensor system show a deviation of 5–10% compared to traditional measurements. © 2024 by the authors.",automation machine; grab-type ship unloader; image processing; point cloud; smart port; YOLO,,"Ministry of SMEs and Startups, MSS",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185915783

Goods transported through seaports in the world are increasing day by day to meet human needs. This increases the pressure to apply more technologies for better port management. The world's seaports in the 4th generation, the generation in which seaports enhance connectivity to form a large network, have shown high efficiency when applying technology to port management. This optimizes port operations and connects port information into a network that improves productivity and reduces loading and unloading times. Today, the Internet of Things is the foundation for technologies to manage and optimize operations in various fields. It is considered by scientists to be a highly influential technology in the “4.0” era. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology directly affects the activities and processes of loading and unloading goods at seaports. Modern IoT-based port management technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) are contributing to the increased speed and safe movement of goods through seaports. The application of IoT in port management has become an inevitable trend and will be presented in this article. In the next generation, seaports tend to develop into smart ports based on rapidly developing technology platforms such as IoT, blockchain, and cloud computing. Smart port development also poses many issues to be resolved, including environmental issues. In this paper, the authors present some solutions to develop smart ports in an environmentally friendly manner. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Seaports are an important component of the shipping industry architecture. Although there is no common solution, seaports around the globe face the same challenge. Challenges raised include difficulties in integrating new technology into automation, traffic congestion, harmonizing residential communities around the port, quantifying and reducing CO2 emissions as well as planning for the energy transition. In addition, improving the adaptability of the port infrastructure in the context of increased pressure from market demand, labor shortage, and escalating prices should be considered. In that context, a smart port was born as a necessity. However, the understanding of smart ports is very limited. This review examines the recently published smart port literature to clarify the common concepts of smart ports and their development progress on the way to building a sustainable seaport ecosystem. Although smart port metrics and key port performance metrics are organized around four key performance areas including operations, environment, energy, and safety. However, a comprehensive review of all four key areas is very broad and difficult to cover in a review article. Therefore, this work focuses on analyzing and discussing the approaches and applications of the technology in smart port energy management systems. Our research has shown that different smart port founding perspectives play a decisive role in technology approaches to building a port energy management system including optimizing algorithms for energy consumption, balancing demand and energy production, and comprehensively integrating renewable energy.

The actual physical systems are also exposed to disturbances unknown to the real-time simulation. Therefore, adaptation is required to ensure reliable performance and to improve the usability of digital twins in monitoring and diagnostics. This study proposes a general approach to the real-time adaptation of digital twins based on a mechanism guided by evolutionary optimization. The mechanism evaluates the deviation between the measured state of the real system and the estimated state provided by the model under adaptation. The deviation is minimized by adapting the model input based on the differential evolution algorithm. To test the mechanism, the measured data were generated via simulations based on a physical model of the real system. The estimated data were generated by a surrogate model, namely a simplified version of the physical model. A case study is presented where the adaptation mechanism is applied on the digital twin of a marine thruster. Satisfactory accuracy was achieved in the optimization during continuous adaptation.

This paper discusses how digital technologies are being applied in other verticals that are further along the maturity curve (i.e., automotive, manufacturing, marine, aerospace) and how they can be leveraged to optimize the lifecycle performance of offshore oil and gas facilities. The paper details the benefits of extending digitalization across the energy enterprise to drive down costs and decouple market volatility from profitability. Case studies will be shared from the aforementioned verticals to illustrate how advanced tools, such as digital twins and enterprise product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions have been successfully applied to reduce product cycle times and improve project execution.

Still, the majority of maritime nodes, residing in MCNs lacks reliable connectivity. Towards this end, integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in sixth generation (6G) MCN topologies results in the formation of an aerial segment, complementing shore base stations that may offer insufficient coverage, and satellite communication, characterized by increased delays. In this study, we focus on an MCN where the direct links towards a shore BS are not available, due to excessive fading conditions. For this case, we use a UAV swarm to provide improved wireless connectivity, adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for high resource efficiency. In downlink communication, UAVs take into consideration the desired service rate and the channel quality of their links towards the maritime nodes. In the uplink, UAVs employ dynamic decoding ordering to enhance the performance of successive interference cancellation, avoiding fixed ordering of the maritime nodes' signals. Moreover, to ensure highly flexible UAV selection, UAVs are equipped with buffers to store data. Performance comparisons show that the UAV swarm-aided MCN enjoys increased average sum-rate by relying on multi-criteria-based interference cancellation and buffer-aided UAVs, over other benchmark schemes in the downlink and uplink.

Thus, this piece of article is important for this journal as it focuses on interdisciplinary cyber security in human aspects and policy perspectives. The issue is emerging on cyber-attack across the globe. The cyber-attack leads to physical consequences especially loss of data, environment and human. This has created concern on level of awareness within maritime management and industry. The level of awareness provides understanding how these affect the industry in order to minimize cost. Main problems are there is no alarm warning for vulnerability of cyber security and there is no mandatory framework on this issue. Thus, this is a conceptual paper reviews concepts and studies to propose the ideas and solution. Therefore, this has brought the idea of cyber risk management whereby involves top-down approach. This does affect the organisation or industry. In addition, investing in maritime cyber security needs a thorough analysis. This could reduce the cyber risk with the use of cyber risk assessment. On the other hand, information sharing is also crucial which reflects this issue on cyber security. Information sharing can also be used with the collaboration from stakeholders. The use of information and communication technology (ICT) makes the process easier, efficient and effective. Maritime industry needs to have smart ports and digital solution with the age of revolution 4.0. Maritime industry players need to integrate the system and services to ensure resilient to such attacks. Required cyber security standards for maritime industry and increase level of awareness can address this issue. Future research will further investigate the cyber risk assessment analysis for cyber safe approach with the understanding of maritime logistic sector to ensure information sharing in supply chain. With the technology, this will improve logistic processes. © SEECMAR.",cyber risk; Cyber security; cyber-attack; maritime industry and cyber safe; vulnerability,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/SSI10-/UMT/02/1)",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144189714

Currently, there is a particular focus on digital twins, where a supplier of equipment should also supply a simulation model of the equipment. Today, the person configuring the simulator must manually connect all required signals between these models, interpreting the meaning of each signal name to determine which signal can be connected together (e.g., connecting ""pressure out"" to ""pressure in"", while ensuring that their units match). This is a tedious and error-prone process. In this paper, we present a method for automatically connecting variables of different models while complying with the FMI standard in co-simulations. This also includes a method for unit conversions. The methods for both automatic connections and unit conversions are based on ontologies. The key idea is to build an ontology, based on existing ontologies, which enables structuring model input and output variables into groups and hierarchies, and assign them a defined type. This enables reasoning about connections between models, and simplifies the model connections. The focus in this paper is to present the ontology, how FMI interface signals can be connected to the ontology, and how this can be used to simplify model connections. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

This can also be extended to solve the problems of equipment downtime and the conflict with operations scheduling in container terminals. This study proposes a simulation based operations scheduling systemthat considers predictive maintenance and downtime schedulesbased on real-time sensors readings within an IoT framework. Specifically, it enables communication between the maintenance department, the control departments, and all entities in the yard blocks of a container terminal. This is to ensure reliability in scheduling operations, eliminate communication delay between equipment breakdown and the maintenance department thus, enabling prompt equipment maintenance or repair. The proposed approach uses sensors connected to the entities in the yard block and enable communication between the several nodes and department using wireless sensor network. It is expected the key performance measures (e.g., vessel berthing time, truck turnaround time, and yard cranes throughput) of the container terminal due the implementation of the proposed approach.

Contemporary ships tend to become continually larger due to economic needs. This trend makes the job of pilots more and more challenging. As a consequence the need for electronic support specifically tailored to pilots' practical requirements grows. The paper will present a graphical user interface design based on Smart Glasses to support pilots in harbor maneuvers. In many harbors, pilots are already supported by Portable Pilot Units (PPUs) usually displaying navigational information on a tablet or laptop. These devices require pilots to look down and to move their gaze away from the most important information source, the direct ship environment. Smart Glasses would allow the pilot to continually look outside of the window and thereby keep focused on the relevant working context. The graphical design has been developed using the well-established Ecological Interface Design (EID) method [16]. This approach has the aim to create interfaces which provide assistance to detect and solve problems especially in unforeseen situations. In accordance with the EID approach we performed a Work Domain Analysis and developed an abstraction hierarchy of the ship in its environment. Additionally, we conducted empirical studies to derive interface requirements in close cooperation with pilots from different harbors in Germany. The interface design takes into account the complete socio-technical system consisting of pilot, vessel, vessel crew, and supporting tugs and tug masters. A prototype has been developed on state-of-the-art Smart Glass devices. The design has finally been evaluated using a scenario-based interview technique. This evaluation underlined the promising opportunities of Smart Glasses for pilots and allowed to derive further requirements to tailor the design even more to the practical needs of pilots.

Smart ports SP express the prevailing trend for the transformation strategies. Although many previous studies discuss smart ports requirements there is no integrated vision provided before to capture different comprehensive elements of smart port and show its impact on sustainably. Therefore, this research aims at developing an integrated smart port index SPI, capturing different elements of SP and linking them to port sustainability performance. The research conducted a systematic literature review to identify all pillars that are required for the smart port adaptation and showed its impact on sustainability with a full-text reading stage that resulted in 48 articles. The paper indicated that few studies of the SPI have been proposed before to improve SP activity in different domains: operations, environment, energy, safety, and security; however, there is a need to address the several key issues related to port operations, and to consider human resources factor as part of the smart port requirement, particularly an integrated index that captures different pillars in SP elements and shows its effect on sustainable performance. The study reveals that SP initiatives around the world have different integration levels. According to this, the smart port index can be considered as the first integrated index linked to sustainability and including human resources; however, there are some limitations that could be an open issue to future researchers and practitioners to foster new practical research initiatives that can rely on this index to adapt the smart port practices in different ports, taking into consideration the human resources aspect and testing their impact on port sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

As the maritime trade witnesses further developments in this field, there will be an inevitable struggle to harmonise the new technology vessels with the traditional rules of law. This article seeks to further the discussion of one of the main legal rules that will have a significant role in shaping sea carriers' liability for goods carried by autonomous vessels: the nautical fault exception, which operates to remove, to some extent, sea carriers' liability for losses arising from the acts or omissions of their employees. The main tenet of this article is that an adapted version of the exception should be available to govern the carriage of goods by new technology vessels. In this context, it advocates the use of legal personhood for the purposes of the nautical fault exception. In so doing, this article contributes to the important debate in employment law on the distribution of the risk of losses arising from autonomous systems when, in future, they take over tasks traditionally carried out by employees. In the absence of employment contracts to perform certain commercial activities, the law will need to decide whether legal personhood should be assigned to autonomous systems for efficient and fair risk allocation. This article illustrates why this may be the solution particularly where there is a 'fine-tuned' balance of liability already struck in the current legal landscape.  © 2021 The Author(s).",,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85157970583

With the deepening development of economic globalization, the scale of international trade, which is the core content of economic globalization, is also expanding, and the shipping industry is also developing greatly. In this paper, aiming at improving the operation efficiency of container terminals, AIS data is used as the research basis to predict the arrival time of ships and reduce the uncertainty of arrival time of ships, so as to provide support for the construction of smart ports. The transitive closure method based on equivalence relation is used to fuzzy cluster the routes to be matched and the historical routes used for matching, and the optimal route matching is realized by cutting set selection. At the same time, the navigation trajectory features based on AIS data are constructed, and the RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Networks-Long Short-Term Memory) model is proposed by using the characteristics of deep learning and time series.The results show that the RNN-LSTM ship trajectory prediction model based on deep learning can achieve excellent prediction results and provide technical support for intelligent transportation at sea.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Deep learning; Law of ship arrival; Route matching; Track prediction,Automatic identification; Forecasting; Image processing; International trade; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Predictive analytics; Ships; Waterway transportation; Economic globalization; Equivalence relations; Intelligent transportation; Maritime transportation; Operation efficiencies; Trajectory features; Trajectory prediction; Transitive closure method; Deep learning,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109208801

The mathematical model for the simulation of the event of pollution is the latest generation and take into account all the meteorological factors of the sea and air, as well as all the physico-chemical parameters of the substances involved (dispersion, surface tension). The simulator is used for the realistic modeling of a crisis situation and it is useful for both marine officers and emergency situation officials. The simulator will be used as an educational instrument enabling the interactive study of the different emergency situations. In this paper we present the simulation of incident and the creation of response resources. The scenario incident is for KAPTAN M cruise ship that left the tourist port of TOMIS Constanta, Romania, having on board 20 passengers and a number of 15 crew members, and which collided with the oil ship EVIA Oil FIVE, having on board the quantity of 4200 MT crude oil. As a result of the collision, the passenger ship suffered a breach (water hole), on the starboard board, breach by which the ship began to ambarce sea water and in the car compartment a fire was produced. Containment and recovery of an oil spill during the exercise will be simulated through activation and control of response resources. The resources involved in the operations are divided into: platforms, equipment and personnel. The results of simulation is the list of response resources specified in the scenario together with their parameters, which can be exported into a text file.

To collect relevant data, buoys are used to set up distributed sensor networks along coastal areas. However, unfavourable weather conditions can lead to downtime, which can be extended due to maintenance issues. The ability to improve the robustness of these sensor systems using predictive models, i.e. digital twins, to interpolate and extrapolate missing data is an important and growing area of research. To accomplish such a task, models must be found that can account for both the spatial and temporal dynamics of the input data to correctly estimate the variables of interest. In this work, a deep learning architecture is proposed to realize a digital twin for the monitoring buoy for significant wave height estimation using spatial and temporal information about the wind field in the area of interest. The proposed methodology was applied to a case study using wave height data from an Italian Sea Monitoring Network buoy installed near the coast of Sicily and wind field data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service ERA5 reanalysis. The reported results show that the use of a multi-block hybrid deep neural network consisting of convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction and short-term memory layers for modelling the involved dynamics, which takes into account the buoy surrounding area, outperforms other empirical, numerical, machine learning and deep learning methods used in the literature. © 2024 The Authors",CNNs; Data-driven models; LSTM; Significant wave height estimation; Soft sensors; Time-series prediction,Italy; Sicily; Climate change; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Numerical methods; Ocean currents; Sensor networks; Water waves; Condition; Data-driven model; Height estimation; Hybrid network; LSTM; Significant wave height; Significant wave height estimation; Soft sensors; Time series prediction; Wind field; artificial neural network; buoy system; coastal zone; coastal zone management; computer simulation; estimation method; height determination; maritime transportation; nearshore dynamics; nearshore environment; numerical model; prediction; risk assessment; sensor; time series; wave field; wave height; wind field; Buoys,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; ISYPORT, (ARS01_01202)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188644906

Thermodynamic models are typically employed for predicting the in-cylinder pressure, which, however, face challenges pertinent to their calibration and computational time requirements. Recent advances in the field of machine learning have leveraged the development of data-driven models. This study aims to compare two approaches for input features and six regression techniques to select the most effective combination for developing data-driven models to predict the in-cylinder pressure of marine four-stroke engines. Two approaches with different input and output features are initially compared. The first employs regression to directly predict the in-cylinder pressure signal, whereas the second predicts the harmonics coefficients by regression and subsequently estimates the in-cylinder pressure by using a Fourier series function. Typical regression techniques, including linear, elastic, and polynomial regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are employed to develop data-driven models based on the second approach. The required datasets for training and testing are derived by using a physical digital twin for the investigated marine engine, which is calibrated against the shop trials and acquired shipboard measurements. The accuracy of the data-driven models are estimated based on the root mean square error considering the testing datasets. For the data-driven model based on the second approach and the ANN regression, a sensitivity study is carried out considering the training datasets and the harmonics number to derive recommendations for these parameters’ values. The results demonstrate that the second approach provides higher accuracy, whereas the ANN regression is the most effective technique for developing data-driven models to estimate the in-cylinder pressure, as the exhibited root mean square error is retained within (Formula presented.) bar for the ANN trained with 20 samples.

However, development and application of DT faces barriers, as they require exhaustive calibration and high computational power, which render their implementation for shipboard systems challenging. This study aims at developing a data-driven DT of low computational cost for predicting instantaneous pressure. Two different approaches using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with distinct input parameters are assessed. The first predicts in-cylinder pressure as a function of the phase angle, whereas the second predicts the discrete Fourier coefficients (FC) corresponding to the in-cylinder pressure variations. The case study of a conventional medium speed four-stroke diesel marine engine is employed, for which the first principle DT based on a thermodynamic, zero-dimensional approach was setup and calibrated against shop trials measurements. The DT is subsequently employed to generate data for training and validating developed ANNs. The derived results demonstrate that the second approach exhibits mean square errors within ±2% and requires the lowest computations cost, rendering it appropriate for marine engines DTs. Sensitivity analysis results verify the amount of training data and number of Fourier coefficients required to achieve adequate accuracy.

An essential driver in this context is digitalisation. Since seaports are also key actors for the sustainable development of coastal regions, it is important that they transform into smart port ecosystems. Hence, the automation and digitisation of ports’ operations are important not only for the ports themselves, but also for the regions and countries hosting regional port ecosystems. Studies on the digitalisation level of ports bear the potential to detect optimal ways for increasing safety, security and visibility in terms of the digital transformation, as well as attracting passengers and freight flows, which in turn positively affects not only the ports, but particularly also the sustainable development of coastal regions. Therefore, the paper presents the results of a conducted assessment of small and medium-sized ports’ digitisation level as well as introduces ways and recommendations how to improve the level of digitisation on the path towards becoming a smarter port ecosystem. The research builds upon key insights from the Connect2SmallPorts project, part-financed by INTERREG South Baltic Programme 2014–2020. Thereby, the research utilises collected primary data concerning ports located in the Baltic, North and Mediterranean Sea Regions. Thus, the study bases on well-grounded theoretical and practical findings in the maritime science field in the nexus of digital transformation. © 2021 Kaunas University of Technology.

There are many reasons for such transformation and interest, including shifting transport of goods from road to sea, reducing ship manning costs, reduced dangerous exposure for crew, and reduced environmental impact. Situational awareness (SA) systems and Autonomous navigation systems (ANS) are key elements of autonomous ships. Safe deployment of ANS will not be feasible based on real-life testing only, but will require large-scale, systematic simulation-based testing in addition to assurance of the development process. DNV GL proposes to use a digital twin, meaning a digital representation of key elements of the autonomous ship as a key tool for simulation-based testing. The digital twin contains comprehensive mathematical models of the ship and its equipment, including all sensors and actuators. The complete simulation-based test system complementing the digital twin should consist of a virtual world to simulate environmental conditions, geographical information and interaction with other maritime traffic. Finally, the test system must include a test management system that controls simulation of the digital twin and the virtual world, generates test scenarios as well as evaluates the test scenario results. An automatic scenario generation tool should search for low ANS performance, and ultimately establish sufficient coverage of the possible scenario space. The test scenario evaluation should automatically consider safety, conformance to collision regulations at sea (COLREG), and possibly also the efficiency of the ship navigation. This paper presents a comprehensive prototype of a test system for ANS. Key topics are simulation-based testing, interfacing the simulator and ANS, cooperation with ANS manufacturers, dynamic test scenario generation, automatic assessment towards COLREG and experiences from the cooperation with The Norwegian Defense Establishment (FFI). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Automatic test scenario generation; Autonomous navigation; Digital twin; Dynamic test scenario; Simulation-based testing,Environmental impact; Freight transportation; Navigation systems; Ship testing; Ships; Unmanned surface vehicles; Virtual reality; Autonomous navigation systems; Digital representations; Environmental conditions; Geographical information; Sensors and actuators; Simulation based verification; Situational awareness; Systematic simulation; Article; automation; controlled study; feasibility study; mathematical computing; mathematical model; priority journal; process development; process model; ship; virtual reality; Digital twin,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084596250

Traditional maritime resource investigation methodologies are hampered by challenges such as elevated costs and risks. Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have emerged as a transformative solution, offering applications previously unattainable or challenging with conventional ships. An essential element in enhancing the capabilities of USVs is the incorporation of 'Digital Twin' (DT) technology, a digital representation mirroring a system's real-world attributes and behaviours. While DT's application has gained traction in other sectors, notably in autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, a focused exploration of its integration in USVs remains sparse. This paper bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive survey of DT within the context of USVs. We review prevailing DT methodologies, delve into multifaceted perspectives surrounding DT-including definitions, classifications and key features, and highlight the prospective directions and challenges for its future application in USVs. Through this study, we underscore the potential of DT in enhancing the capabilities, productivity, and sustainability of USVs in complex maritime environments. © 2023 IEEE.",Digital twin; immersive realities; physical and environmental simulation; Unmanned surface vehicle,Antennas; Sustainable development; Water resources; Aerial vehicle; Autonomous Vehicles; Digital representations; Environmental simulation; Essential elements; Immersive; Immersive reality; Physical simulation; Real-world; Waters resources; Unmanned surface vehicles,"Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Centre of Data Science and Cognitive Computation at XJTLU, (YZCXPT2022103); Suzhou Municipal Key Laboratory for Intelligent Virtual Engineering, (SZS2022004); XJTLU AI University Research Centre; XJTLU Key Program Special Fund of XJTLU, (KSF-A-19); XJTLU Research Development Fund, (RDF-19-02-23); Science and Technology Program of Suzhou, (SYG202122); Science and Technology Program of Suzhou",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186763689

Effective operation at a port is dependent on a timely passage of goods, involving multiple competing objectives, one of which is sustainability. Unsurprisingly, given the extent of a port's operations, it is a significant contributor of emissions. A port is a physically demanding industry in which to work, and any degradation in workforce productivity can have a detrimental effect on the port's effective running. Slow operations, combined with dependencies between port stakeholders, can further amplify unsustainability. There are some efforts to explore the digitalization of ports, including the creation of green and smart ports. However, there is general widespread resistance to the introduction of technology in this domain. There are therefore a number of areas in which to make technical contributions to improve the efficiency of port operations. In this paper, we propose using the satisfaction of staff at a port to influence the efficiency of its operations. In recognition of widespread low staff morale at ports in general, we recognize that staff become dissatisfied as operations move out of their control and the resulting consequences of interruptions to performance can lead to disruptions unable to be rectified quickly or easily, with staff motivation remaining low. Once low and unmotivated, there is a possibility that motivation will remain low even for operations which staff are in control of, with a detrimental effect on the efficiency, and therefore sustainability of the port. We believe that measuring and improving the satisfaction of staff for the efficiency it can bring will be possible through the roll-out of sensors supporting an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture across a port. With satisfied staff, they are likely to be motivated to work in an efficient manner, which will carry through to situations when unexpected circumstances outside their control occur. It is therefore through increased IoT use that port sustainability will be supported in our proposal. Enabling this, staff efficiency and satisfaction can be tracked using a connected service made available using Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The cost of the service and subsequent extent to which staff can be monitored and managed for sustainability objectives can be agreed with a service provider in advance. When staff are satisfied, the port will be operated to sustain low costs. When staff satisfaction begins to decline, however, operation will become focused on the performance of the port to identify where bottlenecks exist in inefficient operations and staff output. While simultaneously managing both cost and performance through the satisfaction of staff, the goal is an overall positive contribution to a port's efficiency and sustainability.

As a reaction to changing market demands and environmental challenges, maritime systems are becoming more complex and coupled. Digital approaches such as digital twins and co-simulation are coping these challenges and offer new opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vessel. In this work, we present the digital twin modelling and the co-simulation of a typical AC ship power and propulsion system including the power stage, relevant local controllers and a high-level controller. The power and control components are modelled individually and exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). To perform a co-simulation of the ship electric power system, the Open Simulation Platform (OSP) is utilized. This co-simulation environment connects the individual FMUs and routes the data between the sub-simulators of the digital twin. A typical test scenario is carried out to demonstrate the correct functioning of the ship power and propulsion system as well as the OSP environment. © 2020 IEEE.",Co-Simulation; Digital Ship; Digital Twin Modelling; Open Simulation Platform (OSP); Ship Power System,Electric power systems; Industrial electronics; Life cycle; Marine power plants; Ship propulsion; Ships; Simulation platform; Control components; Environmental challenges; High level controllers; Local controllers; Maritime industry; Modelling and simulation technologies; Propulsion system; Ship electric power systems; Digital twin,"KSOE; Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd.; Korea Shipbuilding &Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd.",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089468281

A docking system, enabling very precise measurement of distance from vessel to quay aims to provide safe berthing. Such a system, supported by piloting functions (navigational chart and others) provides independent and reliable navigational information, reducing the amount of time spent on the procedure and eliminating uncertainties that could otherwise lead to accidents or incidents-at the very least delays. The increase in container throughput at Koper was made possible by extensive dredging activities and a pier extension. These activities have lengthened the container terminal so that it is now possible to berth a large mother vessel. To assure safe navigation through the narrow and bending channel, a laser-ranging system has been implemented. When a large container vessel is positioning alongside a quay where inadequate fenders are in place and Ship-to-shore (STS) cranes are close to the approaching ship, special care is required and parameters such as precise vessel position, transversal speed, and vessel-approaching angle are of great importance. To provide the information in real time, a laser docking system has been developed and integrated with metocean data.

The present work categorises the available techniques for establishing SHM models in oil rigs, offshore wind turbine structures, subsea systems, vessels, pipelines and so on. Additionally, the capabilities of proposed ideas in recent publications are classified into three main categories: model-based methods, vibration-based methods and digital twin methods. Recently developed novel signal processing and machine learning algorithms are reviewed and their abilities are discussed.

This dimension of geographically concentrated activities is the rationale that ports are characterised by a high-energy demand and a high share of emissions. Driven by a growing awareness for a cleaner environment, a stronger focus on sustainability and intensified environmental regulations, ports are forced to take responsibility when it comes to environmental issues. As a response, in recent studies, the concept of 'green ports' emerged. Simultaneously, in the context of digitalisation, the term 'smart ports' has received growing attention in the latest scientific discussions, too. Since an important driver towards greener maritime operations is linked to digitalisation, we argue that digital efforts in ports should next to the automation of inherent logistics processes also contribute to reducing the emissions and energy demands. Previous studies have primarily concentrated on the automation of container handling operations. Hence, there exists a research gap concerning the automation of bulk cargo handling operations in ports. Thus, this study addresses the question of how to automate the dry bulk cargo loading operations in the frame of a green and smart port development. The developed case study refers to the seaport of Wismar, whereby the results show that the digitalisation and greener port operations can be successfully aligned. Overall, this study extends the discussion on green and smart port development, while it contributes to the scientific literature by proving that both conceptual ideas can be achieved in the operating business. © 2021 Robert Philipp et al., published by Sciendo.",5G networks; Clean port operations; digital transformation; digitalisation; emission reductions; IIoT (Industrial-Internet-of-Things); sustainable energy management,Europe; Automation; Emission control; Energy management; Environmental regulations; Internet of things; Queueing networks; Sustainable development; Bulk Cargo; Clean port operation; Digital transformation; Digitalization; Emission reduction; Energy demands; Industrial-internet-of-thing; Loading operations; Port operations; Sustainable energy management; alternative energy; automation; cargo handling; demand-side management; emission control; environmental issue; environmental protection; green economy; port development; port operation; technology adoption; transportation policy; 5G mobile communication systems,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117726043

Among the different directives of IMO, currently especially the sulphur emission regulations pose challenges for the shipping industry. Related to this are the established Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and the introduced global sulphur cap. To comply with the sulphur restrictions, according to the present technological state of the art, ship-owners have three options for their existing fleet: the installation of emission abatement technologies, the switch to low sulphur fuels, or retrofitting for the usage of alternative fuels. Regardless which option is favoured, most often selected solutions still depend on fossil fuels. The reasons for this can be traced back to the fact that supply of biofuels is not ensured in ports and generally seen as no profitable solution. This paper develops and examines an innovative business model with a special focus on liquefied biogas (LBG). The study bases on collected qualitative and quantitative data, which was used by applying the Business Model Canvas. The results will highlight that the business model bears the potential to promote LBG supply. Next to this, the research will show that blockchain and smart contracts are able to foster the implementation of the business model and optimisation of value chain operations.

In harsh environments and shallow water conditions, thruster assisted position mooring configurations are often the preferred choice as the mooring lines provide an extra help to counteract the environmental loads. Drilling operations, both in pure DP or thruster-assisted position mooring modes, are limited by the ability of the vessel to maintain position and heading within the required accuracy. In addition, the motion in heave, roll and pitch must be within predefined limits. These limits vary between the type of operation to be performed. For example, reconnecting the low marine riser package has much stricter motion limitations compared to logging or drilling through riser operations. All these operations need to be carefully planned; and having estimate in advance of the vessel motion and station-keeping performance could be of vital importance, also considering planned maintenance. The aim of this paper is to share experiences in planning DP drilling operations by using cloud-based time-domain simulations performed with a digital twin of a semi-submersible drilling rig. A digital twin is a virtual representation of an asset, used from early design through building and operations, maintained and easily accessible throughout its lifecycle. A digital twin can replicate many aspects of the asset; in the case of planning DP drilling operations, our digital twin includes time-domain models for running simulations and predicting the vessel motion.

However, increased biomass, nutrient concentrations and oxygen demand do not lead to undesirable environmental effects if the flow of carbon/energy from primary producers toward high trophic levels is consistently preserved. Consequently, traditional indicators might provide a misleading assessment of the eutrophication risk. To avoid this, we propose to evaluate eutrophication by using a new index based on plankton trophic fluxes instead of biogeochemical concentrations. A preliminary, model-based, assessment suggests that this approach might give a substantially different picture of the eutrophication status of our seas, with potential consequences on marine ecosystem management. Given the difficulties to measure trophic fluxes in the field, the use of numerical simulations is recommended although the uncertainty associated with biogeochemical models inevitably affects the reliability of the index. However, given the effort currently in place to develop refined numerical tools describing the marine environment (Ocean Digital Twins), a reliable, model-based, eutrophication index could be operational in the near future.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Port and harbor operations connect the maritime transport to other modes of transportation and enable multimodal transportation. Smart ports play a central role in future transport logistics and supply chains. Digitalization helps improve the efficiency of terminal systems in the processes of these ports. In the best cases, digitalization can also promote the reduction of emissions by optimizing port operations and enhancing cargo and people flows while improving the experience for all stakeholders.

Digitalization of seaport services makes it possible to increase the efficiency of terminal systems in the logistic processes. At the same time, port logistic processes can notably reduce its CO2 emissions by optimizing port operations. The improvement of port processes relies very much on the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Operation Technologies (OT) systems. In port environment there are parts that are controlled (ICS/OT) from the cyber environment but directly interact with the physical surroundings. These are called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

Digitalization helps improve the efficiency of terminal systems in the processes of these ports. In Finland this development is going on and it is called SMARTER research program. In the best cases, digitalization can also promote the reduction of emissions by optimizing port operations and enhancing cargo and people flows while improving the experience for all stakeholders. The improvement of port processes relies on the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and as well as on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Operation Technologies (OT). At the same time, the cyber security aspects of maritime logistics also need to be addressed. In Finland, the SMARTER research program has been established to create port services by using, among other tools, Industry 4.0 solutions. As critical systems become more complicated in terms of users, processes and technology, the entire port infrastructure becomes a complex system of systems environment characterized by a conglomeration of interconnected networks and dependencies. ICT systems are significant parts of the operations and core processes, and are related to the administration and management of information in the network. The components of process levels include ICS/OT systems as well. This paper presents findings related to the SMARTER research goal on cyber security, which is a comprehensive cyber security architecture for port services at the system level. The paper emphasizes the importance of system description and recognizing basic system elements and their description in the first phase of the research process. The descriptions of these elements are needed to answer the following question at the beginning of the research: What are the basic elements of cyber security for a smart terminal process? The main elements identified in this paper are activities, the recognition of every stakeholder and the relationships between them, security dimensions, security capabilities, and system views of organizational criteria for cyber security in the SMARTER system. The solution can be called the Smart Port Cyber Security Management System (PortCSMS).",Maritime Logistics; Smart Port; Cyber Security Management; SMARTER,RESILIENCE,,Conference paper,,,,

The NFRPCs manufactured through conventional and computer-controlled intelligent manufacturing techniques may contain internal and external defects. Traditionally, the microstructure of NFRPCs at different stages of manufacturing was obtained using destructive techniques which have stringent sample size restrictions and may cause a decrease in residual properties of composites due to destructive scanning. However, these complications can be overcome by using non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This review highlights the impact of NDE and AI on the improvement of emerging manufacturing systems. We have discussed the classification of biocomposites, their manufacturing techniques, recyclability and strategies to improve mechanical properties. Further, the use of different types of contact and non-contact NDE techniques in understanding the microstructural variations during manufacturing, machining and the parameters that affect the mechanical performance of NFRPCs are discussed. The use of NDE images in developing the geometrical and computational models of NFRPCs is presented. We have highlighted the importance of AI technology in enhancing the quality of NDE images, improving the microstructural information before post-processing the data, and minimizing the analysis time and identifying the defects and damages in NFRPCs. In the end, we presented the application of NDE techniques and AI technology in efficient generation of digital material twins of NFRPCs, which will be useful to design next-generation biocomposites.

Owing to an IoT device's limited resources and restricted computing power, heavy computing tasks are generally offloaded to edge servers, where a digital twin (DT) of the IoT device is synchronized using the current information from the physical device, followed by completing the computing task and returning the results. Notably, this strategy must be completed within time constraints while ensuring that the device is not overtaxed by its computations. The problem is that offloading solution is not efficient enough to meet time and energy requirements for critical tasks. Simultaneously, the success rate of offloading solutions affects computing efficiency. To address these problems, this study formulates a mathematical model of energy consumption optimization under time constraints and proposes a binary problem-enabled marine predator algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively meets deadlines while reducing energy consumption, even with an increasing number of users. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Computer application technology; Digital twin; Edge computing; Internet of things; Task offloading,Computation offloading; Computing power; Digital devices; Energy utilization; Green computing; 'current; Computer applications technologies; Computing power; Computing-task; Edge computing; Edge server; Mobile Internet; Physical devices; Task offloading; Time constraints; Internet of things,"Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission, (6140001030111, 6140002010101)",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186503975

Firstly, the aim is in increasing understanding of phenomena of a customer value. Secondly, the customer value is researched empirically in case studies in maritime and in forest industry. The case studies focus on analyzing the technology providers’ digital solutions as risk mitigation investments where the cost-effectiveness is of central concern and where the benefits arise largely from the avoidance or reduction of negative consequences in the operation and maintenance phases of the asset life cycle.

Moreover, the SWOT matrix will analytically assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of incorporating IoT into Moroccan ports. The result highlights that IoT applications have the potential to improve port performance, contingent upon considering the opportunities and the strengths. However, multifaceted challenges could be present in the process of integrating this technology in the Moroccan port field. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Delphi method; Integration; Internet of Things (IoT); Moroccan ports; Port performance; SWOT matrix,Decision making; Integration; Matrix algebra; Ports and harbors; Case-studies; Delphi method; Internet of thing; Internet of things technologies; Maritime industry; matrix; Moroccan port; Performance; Port performance; SWOT matrix; Internet of things,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186405258

Our DT aims at: i) avoiding over- or under-designing the system; ii) extrapolating from one system to a fleet of systems; and iii) estimating the costs of our offshore operations. These costs are evaluated as cost per kilogram of extracted plastic which is our Key Performance Indicator (KPI). One of the main contributing parameters to the KPI is the hydrodynamic load of our ""U-shape"" device that spans up to 630 meters and operates at a Speed Through Water (STW or ustw) up to 1.5 m/s equivalent to a twine Reynolds number of Ret∗ = 1600. The DT is built with OrcaFlex (OF) using lines and links, the Naumov’s drag correlation and on a no-wave assumption. Data collected from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) are utilised to increase the accuracy of our DT for estimating the loads and the system’s dynamic deformation. The DT is built using a three-cycle validation: i) initial guess applying the Naumov’s semi-empirical drag correlation to define OF drag coefficients which is excluding the influence of the local angles of attack (AoAs); ii) calibration of the OF drag coefficients using AquaSim (AS) with its twine-by-twine drag correlation for various AoAs; iii) recalibration of the OF drag coefficients from two-dimensional CFD simulations using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for a twine-by-twine establishment of a drag correlation on a one meter segment plane net to account for shielding effects at AoA < 24◦. By doing so, we decrease the discrepancy of our OF model, on large spans, with an error less than 15% compared to the GPGP data. For a narrow span, mostly exhibiting very low AoAs, the first cycle shows a 300% discrepancy whereas at the end of the third cycle it shows a 50% discrepancy.

The integrity management of such assets will shape the future of the Brazilian oil production in the next years. The implementation of state-of-the-art tools and the development of new solutions via R,D&I projects are important steps on the path to increase the integrity management evolution. Several programs and activities are in course on the three major related areas for the operational assurance of the asset: subsea, topsides and marine (including vessel structure). The inspection and maintenance markets were forced to accelerate the tools and systems development during the last years of Pandemic due to social distancing rules, so the need to remotely control activities and equipment became more important and valuable. The necessity to keep people away of the site has pushed the implementation of wearables, permanent monitoring systems usage, drones, robots and ROVs (Remoted Operated Vehicles), mini-ROVs and AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). The operation team is currently investigating new ways to reduce human effort in tasks such as thickness measurement and visual inspection by using recent technologies to improve the inspection quality. This paper aims to outline the integrity management evolution roadmap, which is based on integrated programs on subsea, topsides, and marine inspection and maintenance that, working aligned, will end in a centrally stored collected data from several sources that will be available and displayed in each asset's Digital Twin model. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.",,Commerce; Digital storage; Inspection; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Remotely operated vehicles; Thickness measurement; Brazilian oil; Inspection and maintenance; Integrity management; New solutions; Oil-production; PETROBRAS; Roadmap; State of the art; Tool development; Vessel structure; Autonomous underwater vehicles,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156112502

State-of-the-art obstacle detection algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs provide higher detection accuracy and fast detection speed, they require enormous amounts of data for their training. In particular, the availability of domain-specific datasets is a challenge for obstacle detection. The difficulty in conducting onsite experiments limits the collection of maritime datasets. Owing to the logistic cost of conducting on-site operations, simulation tools provide a safe and cost-efficient alternative for data collection. In this work, we introduce SimuShips, a publicly available simulation-based dataset for maritime environments. Our dataset consists of 9471 high-resolution (1920x1080) images which include a wide range of obstacle types, atmospheric and illumination conditions along with occlusion, scale and visible proportion variations. We provide annotations in the form of bounding boxes. In addition, we conduct experiments with YOLOv5 to test the viability of simulation data.

Aiming at the problem of lack of broad and integrated digital twin implementations with live data along with the absence of a digital twin-driven framework for AMSV design and development, an application framework for the development of a fully autonomous vessel using an integrated digital twin in a 3D simulation environment has been presented. Our framework has 4 layers which ensure that simulation and real-world vessel and the environment are as close as possible. Åboat, an in-house, experimental research platform for maritime automation and autonomous surface vessel applications, equipped with two trolling electric motors, cameras, LiDARs, IMU and GPS has been used as the case study to provide a proof of concept. Åboat, its sensors, and the environment have been replicated in a commercial, 3D simulation environment, AILiveSim. Using the proposed application framework, we develop obstacle detection and path planning systems based on machine learning which leverage live data from a 3D simulation environment to mirror the complex dynamics of the real world.

Considering electrical cell-to-cell variations (CtCVs) within the underlying battery model of such a digital twin promises various advantages in the fields of model-based optimization and predictive maintenance. However, the existing approaches for both the characterization and modeling of CtCVs are unsuited for large-scale systems consisting of thousands of individual cells. In this context, this paper introduces a holistic tool chain comprising three main elements: First, a non-destructive method for the in-situ determination of resistance and capacity distributions within a battery system is presented. The method was evaluated on a commercial battery module for stationary applications consisting of 64 Ah pouch cells in 14s2p configuration. In the second step, the obtained distributions were used to parameterize a state-of-the-art multi-cell battery model, which allows the calculation of the voltage distribution within the system. The validation showed that the resulting model is able to calculate the voltage spread (Vcell,max(t)−Vcell,min(t)) with a mean average error of 1.1 mV for a 24 h load profile. In the third step, multivariate statistical analysis was used on the obtained parameters in order to simplify the original model and thereby reducing its computational demands. The simplification approach allows the calculation of envelope voltages curves within which a random cell can be found with a given probability. In comparison to the original model, the simplified model was able to represent the voltage extrema while reducing the computation time by a factor of 27. This renders the simplified model applicable for live digital twin applications for large-scale battery systems. © 2022 The Authors",Batteries; Cell-to-cell variations; Digital twin; Marine; Stationary; System modeling,Battery management systems; Large scale systems; Marine applications; Multivariant analysis; Nondestructive examination; Battery; Battery modeling; Battery systems; Cell-to-cell variation; Electrical cells; Large-scales; Marine; Stationary; Stationary applications; System models; Lithium-ion batteries,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (861647)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142767831

With increasing utilisation of flexible pipe for current and future field developments, compounded by the recurrent need for field life extension, it is essential to monitor the riser fatigue regularly to maintain integrity, maximise asset life and to allow for informed appraisal before extending its operational life. This paper presents a novel method of using the refined finite element analysis (FEA) in combination with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop a riser digital twin that can be utilised as an operational decision-making tool for integrity management and life extension. A digital twin model is trained on a subset of available metocean and vessel motion data utilising advanced neural networks which can then be utilised to predict fatigue under the full spectrum of metocean and internal pressure conditions. This approach allows for a significant reduction in the estimation time of the fatigue damage compared to conventional FEA as well as improved accuracy of prediction. The methodology presented in the paper has been primarily developed with the view of deepwater riser applications but is easily adaptable to shallow water application in combination with various floating vessels. A case study is presented to demonstrate how this technology is being deployed offshore. A comparison of FEA and digital twin approach is also presented to highlight the speed and efficiency of digital twin model whereby real-time insights on fatigue life can be evaluated for informed operational decisions.

In the past, HABs have been assessed mainly by the manual collection and subsequent analysis of water samples and occasionally by automatic instruments that acquire information from fixed locations. These procedures do not provide data with the desirable spatial and temporal resolution to anticipate the formation of HABs. Hence, new tools and technologies are needed to efficiently detect, characterize and respond to HABs that threaten water quality. It is essential nowadays when the world’s water supply is under tremendous pressure because of climate change, overexploitation, and pollution.

The benefits of this approach, involving ""living-learning""models for diagnostic, prognostic and system optimizations are suggested in literature as many. When deploying such an approach, there are many discussions and decisions around modelling techniques to deploy, and the required fidelity of such models. It can be assumed though that the greater the potential to gain real measurement data, the greater the opportunity to improve the overall system model accuracy.This paper develops a model of a previously overlooked but essential part of the engine control system-the measuring chain relating to the closed-loop engine combustion controller. This part of the system performs an essential role to provide real-time data for the engine control loop, to be able to optimize the engine performance on a cylinder-by-cylinder, cycle-by-cycle basis. However, failure of this part of the system can often be impossible to distinguish from an engine fault when there is no knowledge of the system health of the measuring chain.

Accurate and efficient computation of tensile armor wire stress time-histories is the key to enabling the implementation of a flexible riser digital twin. Accuracy requires capturing the nonlinear kinematics of the flexible’s helically contra-wound tensile armor layers and their interaction with the other metallic and thermo-plastic layers in a dynamic simulation. While it is generally accepted that high-fidelity 3D finite element models best capture the complex kinematics required to produce accurate stresses, the main issue is that simulation time remains prohibitive, for example, a single bending cycle on modern day multi-core computers typically requires 24-48 hours. Therefore, any successful implementation of a flexible riser digital twin requires an accelerated solver capable of real-time computation of 1000s of bending cycle inputs into the high-fidelity finite element model.

Using digital twin technology, the authors will model and simulate the physical entity of the dockyard to optimize for a set of critical priorities. Digital twins are virtual representations of a physical entity, such as a vehicle. They can fully model a complex environment, accurately modelling individual layers within the entity, with each layer accessing data required from other layers. This results in an accurate simulation so that when changes are made in one layer of the model, the impact across the other layers may be observed. An end-user could interact with this digital twin to understand how changing input parameters would affect the measured outputs, allowing the end-users to simulate different options and compare the simulated outcomes before deciding a course of action. If the digital twin is of higher fidelity, the simulated outcomes would be more accurate and demonstrate potentially unintended effects allowing for a more comprehensive overview for the decision-maker. From this digital twin, a decision-maker can manually identify the best parameters to simulate the outcomes through the digital twin. However, using multi-objective optimization can reduce this process so that the twin can create the inputs, monitor the outcomes, and repeatedly try to produce a specific number of outcomes to choose from. These outcomes would be based on a few priorities initially set, and the optimizer would change inputs to enhance each of these priorities. At HMNB Devonport, three main priorities have been identified: cost reduction, time efficiency and carbon neutrality.  © 2022 NATO CCDCOE.",digital twin; dockyard logistics; multi-objective optimization; visualization,Cost reduction; Decision making; Docks; Hydraulic structures; Naval bases; Decision makers; Devonport; Dockyard logistic; End-users; Maritime sites; Multi-objectives optimization; Naval Base; Plymouth; United kingdom; Virtual representations; Multiobjective optimization,"Ministry of Defence, MOD",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134418235

However, to create a comprehensive hydrodynamic database with tens of input parameters including vibration amplitudes and frequencies and Reynolds number, surface roughness and so forth is technically challenging and virtually impossible due to the large number of experiments required. The current work presents an alternative approach to approximate the crossflow (CF) hydrodynamic coefficient database in a carefully chosen parameterized form. The learning of the parameters is posed as a constraint optimization, where the objective function is constructed based on the error between the experimental response and theoretical prediction assuming energy balance between fluid and structure. Such a method yields the optimal estimation of the CF parametric hydrodynamic database and produces the VIV response prediction based on the updated hydrodynamic database. The method then was tested on several experiments, including freely-mounted rigid cylinder in large Reynolds number with combined crossflow and inline vibrations and large-scale flexible cylinder test in the Norwegian Deepwater Program, and the result is shown to robustly and significantly reduce the error in predicting cylinder VIVs. © 2021 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).",Digital Twin; Hydrodynamic Database; Marine Risers; Optimization; VIV,Arctic engineering; Constrained optimization; Cylinders (shapes); Forecasting; Hydrodynamics; Reynolds number; Software testing; Surface roughness; Vortex flow; Constraint optimizations; Cross-flow vibrations; Cylindrical structure; Hydrodynamic coefficients; Objective functions; Optimal estimations; Vibration amplitude; Vortex-induced vibration; Database systems,"SAIPEM; American Bureau of Shipping, ABS; Shell United States; Petrobras; ExxonMobil Foundation",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115202505

The forces are expressed in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients, which depend on several variables and parameters, including the structural properties and geometry, frequency and amplitude of vibration, and the flow conditions, so that a comprehensive database obtained with systematic experiments would require an intractably large number of tests. Therefore, we develop a method for determining optimal parametric hydrodynamic databases directly from a variety of free- and forced-vibration experiments on both rigid and flexible cylinders, by minimizing the error between the predicted responses using a software driven by the force database, and the measured data. We first describe the process of selecting an appropriate parametrization of the fluid forces as function of reduced frequency and non-dimensional amplitude of vibration, informed by Gaussian-Process-Regression-guided automated experiments. Several examples are selected to demonstrate the method's ability to acquire optimal hydrodynamic databases, including data sets highlighting the effect of Reynolds number and the addition of in-line motion to cross-flow rigid cylinder VIV. The proposed methodology is further demonstrated to be effective when used with the semi-empirical program VIVA for flexible cylinder VIV, yielding significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to baseline results. It therefore serves as a potential solution for the development of a digital twin for marine risers, an in-situ, real-time riser response prediction and structural health monitoring system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twin; Forced vibration; Hydrodynamic database; Optimization; VIV,Cylinders (shapes); Database systems; Flexible structures; Forecasting; Hydrodynamics; Marine risers; Reynolds number; Structural health monitoring; Vibrations (mechanical); Vortex flow; Accurate response; Cross flows; Flexible cylinders; Fluid forces; Forced vibration; Hydrodynamic database; Optimisations; Response prediction; Rigid cylinder; Vortex induced vibration; Fluid structure interaction,"MIT Digital Twin of Marine Risers Consortium; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1902972); BP; Chevron; American Bureau of Shipping, ABS; Shell United States; Petrobras; ExxonMobil Foundation",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131134425

As a result, a new concept has emerged known as Digital Twins (DT), which is defined as ""a virtual representation of various objects or systems that receive data from physical objects/systems to make changes and corrections&#x201D;. In the aviation industry, numerous attempts have been made to utilize DT in the design, manufacturing, and condition monitoring of aircraft fleets. Among these research efforts, real-time, accurate, fast, and predictive condition monitoring methods play a crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient performance of aircraft. Using DT for condition and fleet monitoring not only enhances the reliability and safety of aircraft but also reduces operational and maintenance costs. In this paper, the conducted studies on the applications of DT systems for condition monitoring of aircraft units and the aerospace sector are discussed and reviewed. The aim of this review paper is to analyse the current developments of DT systems in the aviation industry as well as explain the remaining challenges of DT systems. Then Finally, future trends of DT systems along with aircraft are presented. Among reviewed papers, most of them have used computational fluid dynamics, finite element methods, and artificial intelligence techniques for developing DT models for aircraft. At the same time, most of these analyses are dedicated to the failure and crack detection body of aircraft as well as engine fault detection. Life prediction is another popular application for using DT in aircraft units that could help the engineers predict the maintenance required for different parts of the aircraft. Finally, the application of DT in marine, power systems, and space programs has been also reviewed and the lessons learned from them have been translated to the aviation sector.

Hence, the purpose of this study the development and evaluation of ports play a key role in their commercial success. Development policies can be formulated for these ports by properly evaluating their performance indicators. On the other hand, traditional methods of performance evaluation cannot provide a good multidimensional evaluation of the status of ports. Design/methodology/approach: More than 90% of the world’s heavy transit today is carried out by the sea. With this volume of freight, transit accidents are inevitable for ships passing through oceans, seas, waterways, rivers, ports and mooring at docks. Besides, gases from ships’ fuels at sea, especially in ports, oil spills due to maritime incidents, the negligence of the ship’s crew, the use of port equipment, dirty fuel of diesel power substations, etc., have increased greenhouse gases, polluted the environment and endangered human lives. Findings: A new approach has been introduced in the field of port performance evaluation based on the components of greenness and intelligence. This approach performs evaluations in two stages and a network. In this study, the performance of 11 Iranian ports was evaluated based on the network data envelopment analysis approach in 2 stages of greenness and intelligence during 4 years. The results indicated that only 5% of the ports meet the standards of intelligence and greenness. Originality/value: On the other hand, as shown in the above studies, the issue of green ports is directly related to the development of animal and plant ecosystems in the seas and the environment around ports. The presence of pollution in the ports has caused the animal and plant habitats around the ports to face a complete pollution crisis or to be completely destroyed. Therefore, the development of green port concepts in third world countries will help prevent environmental pollution of the seas. Therefore, it is necessary for ports to review their strategic maritime transport model and use the development of green port indicators in their implementation processes. Therefore, the strategic development of green ports is created to create and benefit from the components of intelligence, and as mentioned in previous research, intelligence and greenness are in line and the lack of development of one of the concepts causes defects in others. According to reports provided in Iran’s maritime transport systems, most accidents have led to environmental disasters during the absence of intelligent equipment. The use of smart technologies prevents all environmental damage and the development of port services. On the other hand, in evaluating the published articles in the field of development of green and smart ports, so far, the components of intelligence and greenness have not been evaluated and analyzed in a practical and operational way in ports and only the influencing the development of agents on each other has been done (Chen, 2019). Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of ports based on green components and intelligence causes ports to fundamentally review their executive infrastructure and take an active part in the global green development plan. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Greenness; Intelligence; Logistics; Modeling; Network data envelopment analysis (DEA); Transit ports,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116446661

Port authorities and terminals need to constantly adapt and face challenges related to maritime infrastructure, equipment, and operations, as these are the principal areas affected by the future Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs). Maneuvring areas are at their limits, and mooring equipment is at an increased risk of being overloaded. This study aims to analyze the limitations that present mooring systems may face when ULCVs are subjected to wind and passing-ship forces exerted by a future ULCV and wind forces through Dynamic Mooring Analysis (DMA). A hypothetical and massive future ULCV with a capacity of 40,000 TEU is compared to the Emma Maersk, which is a present vessel that regularly calls at container terminals. The Emma Maersk, with its current mooring arrangement, experiences higher motion than future ULCVs, which experience higher forces but are also moored with more and stronger lines. This translates into considerably higher loads in the mooring system, potentially compromising safe mooring conditions at the terminal. Mitigating measures are proposed in the study to face these limitations. In addition, the study explores the potential of new and innovative mooring technologies, such as high-strength synthetic ropes and smart mooring systems, to address the challenges posed by ULCVs. A container terminal at the Port of Rotterdam, Europe's largest sea port, has been analyzed as a case study. The terminal is located next to a busy fairway that leads to other container terminals, justifying the need to analyze both wind and passing-ship effects on moored ships.",ship-wave; downtime; container vessel; harbor agitation; mooring,,Arcadis Nederland; IH-Cantabria,Article,,,,

The potential advantages of smart and environmentally friendly ports for Indonesia are examined in this study. Ports can serve as catalysts for the economy, lower logistics costs, environmental sustainability, improved global competitiveness, and climate change mitigation. Ports may support efforts around the world to lessen the effects of climate change by using sustainable practices and technologies. By looking at successful examples from other countries and analyzing the potential benefits of implementing green and smart ports for Indonesia’s maritime industry, economy, and environment, this study aims to provide insightful analysis and recommendations for policymakers, port authorities, and other stake-holders in the country’s maritime industry. In conclusion, effective and sustainable port operations can help a nation’s economy and environment in the long run by spurring economic development, lowering logistical costs, improving global competitiveness, and aiding in environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation initiatives. © 2024, SEECMAR.

With advancements in structural health monitoring (SHM) methods and implementations, DT-based maintenance and operation stages have been implemented significantly during the life cycle of civil infrastructure. Recent literature has started laying the building blocks for incorporating the concept of DTs with SHM of large-scale civil infrastructure. This paper undertakes a systematic literature review of studies on DT-related applications for SHM of civil structures. It classifies the articles based on thematic case studies: transportation infrastructure (i.e. bridges, tunnels, roads, and pavements), buildings, off-shore marine infrastructure and wind turbines, and other civil engineering systems. The proposed review is further uniquely sub-classified using diverse modeling approaches such as building information modeling, finite element modeling, 3D representation, and surrogate and hybrid modeling used in DT implementations. This paper is solely focused on applications relating DTs to SHM practices for various civil engineering infrastructures, hence highlighting its novelty over previous reviews. Gaps and limitations emerging from the systematic review are presented, followed by articulating future research directions and key conclusions. © 2024 The Author(s).

Recent developments in Digital Twinning (DT) enable the online availability of operational data from the physical asset required for operational validation. The benefits of DT in situations where operational validation has formed a basis for model adaptation has also been demonstrated. However, these benefits within DT have not been fully utilized due to the lack of an approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and diversity of validation data and performance metrics for online model validation and adaptation. Therefore, there is a need for a framework for benchmarking validation data and metrics requirements during model validation in different domains. An approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and variability of validation data and performance metric(s) for online model adaptation within DT is proposed. The approach is focused on addressing the problem of parameter(s) uncertainty of a predictive model within its uncertainty boundary. It involves generating virtual test models, a primary and another reference model for the performance evaluation of one compared to the another with the benchmarked validating data and metrics within DT. This process is repeated until the dataset and/or metric(s) are promising enough to validate primary model against the reference model. The proposed approach is demonstrated using BEASY - a simulator designed to predict protection provided by a cathodic protection system to an asset. In this case, a marine structure is the focus of the study, where the protection potentials to prevent corrosion are predicted over the life of the structure.

Achieving this evolution is a task full of challenges. One of these challenges is the interoperability of the stakeholders' information systems. Interoperability has been widely studied but there is still some reluctance to adopt the solutions because the stakeholders are afraid of sharing their data. Recently, the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture proposes several recommendations and specifications to solve this issue based on data sovereignty concept. This architecture has not been studied nor implemented for the seaport use case yet. For this reason, this paper presents a seaport data space based on IDS architecture to share information in a secure and interoperable manner. Along with this, a big data architecture is added to exploit the shared data. The seaport data space is implemented using the FIWARE IoT platform. The seaport data space is tested by sharing the data of the port authority to the port terminal and analyzing the large shared data through descriptive analysis. The results show that by using the seaport data space, the shared data allow improving the decision making in the planning operations of the seaport. © 2019 IEEE.",Big Data; IDS; Industry; Internet of Things; Interoperability; seaport,Big data; Decision making; Industry; Interoperability; Network security; Ports and harbors; Data architectures; Data space; Descriptive analysis; Industrial datum; Port authorities; Reference architecture; seaport; Shared data; Internet of things,"Ecuadorian Government; Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, SENESCYT; Horizon 2020, (769355)",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073904575

The method exploits the geometric nonlinearity of mooring systems installed in shallow to moderate water depths: a change of line length (due to winching) affects the local dynamic stiffness of the mooring line. Based on measurements of fairlead displacements and of the dynamic part of the top tension, the line length and true (unbiased) mean tension can be inferred. The method combines the use of (1) a classical kinematic observer to derive fairlead motions, (2) the compression of the recent history of fairlead motions to a few parameters, (3) a bank of neural networks, each network modelling the response corresponding to a given line length/static tension, and (4) a heuristic approach to selecting the most promising model among the candidates. One major advantage of the method is its sparsity, making it computationally efficient so it can be applied both offline, on large sets of recorded historical data, and online running on lightweight embedded hardware. The paper presents in detail each component listed above, and the method as a whole is verified on a realistic case. Given that enough excitation is present, the estimator was found to converge towards the true value of the tension, and to cope well with transient conditions such as winching operations, and with the presence of oceanic current. © 2022 The Author(s)",Condition monitoring; Digital twin; Mooring; Sensor fusion; Slender marine structures,Condition monitoring; Heuristic methods; Mooring cables; Dynamic stiffness; Fusion methods; Geometric non-linearity; Local dynamics; Mooring line; Mooring system; Sensor fusion; Slende marine structure; Top tensions; Water depth; computer simulation; estimation method; heuristics; kinematics; measurement method; mooring system; nonlinearity; numerical model; oceanic current; offshore structure; stiffness; tension; Mooring,"Norges Forskningsråd, (280705)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139330446

Digitalization is playing a key role in being resilient and efficient, while remotization is the new normality in everyday work. Being able to transfer such technologies to the shipping sector and use them to take data driven decisions, enhance regulatory compliance and monitor the asset life cycle can give to owners and shipping companies real advantages in overcoming the new challenges the business faces. In the actual and near future, one of the major challenges that the marine sector must face is represented by the global decarbonization targets, which will impose strong changes to the whole shipping sector. Due to these ambitious targets, every shipping company will be forced to work on three main pillars: new fuels, new technologies, optimized operational measures. Fleet performance management and digitalization play a key role in the optimization of the operational measures: monitoring efficiency, proving, and ensuring compliance with the upcoming regulations and optimizing reporting operations on board. With the upcoming regulations, it will become even more important to always know how a vessel is performing, being capable of simulating the ship's behavior in different operational conditions and reduce the carbon footprint of a fleet by deploying the whole fleet in the most efficient way. When the vessels emissions need to be reduced as much as possible, the focus should be on how collect the information on board, ensure that the information is reliable and have tools to manage such data and enhance decision making. This paper will explain the importance of data and how digital tools are starting to permeate the life of the shipping companies, helping both onboard and ashore personnel in enhancing operations: from electronic logbooks to live monitoring of scrubber systems, from collecting data on board to building the hydrodynamic digital twin of the vessel to be used in weather routing applications.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

Fundamental exploration of algorithms and approaches to link, compare, and fuse numerical models used in digital twins with real-world sensor data is still needed for ship performance prediction, condition assessment, and ultimately, significant implementation of digital twin technology in the marine industry. In this work, a preliminary digital twin framework for surface ships has been developed to yield time-and-place specific predictions of vessel motions and structural responses given weather forecast or hindcast data for a selected route. Cumulative fatigue damage was predicted and compared for four simulated routes in the Pacific Ocean, and the predicted motions for the simulation with the greatest fatigue damage were analyzed to investigate the possible causes of this increased damage. The notable increase in cumulative damage seen for this route stresses the importance of the ability to track and balance fatigue damage among ships in a fleet. Moreover, this information would further support educated maintenance and deployment scheduling decisions to ensure fatigue damage equality among ships in a fleet, while real-time implementation of this digital twin technology would furnish operators with a greater understanding of a weather forecast’s implications, and thereby provide in-mission decision support. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,Decision support systems; Fleet operations; Life cycle; Marine engineering; Marine industry; Real time control; Ships; Weather forecasting; Condition assessments; Cumulative fatigue damage; Fatigue damage estimation; Life-cycle management; Real-time implementations; Scheduling decisions; Structural response; Virtual representations; Fatigue damage,"Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-17-1-2982)",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063962295

Energy consumption modelling in buildings is a fundamental part of developing a building energy digital twin, which allows the use of a virtual environment to run 'what-if' simulations to explore the impact of design modifications for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. This paper focuses principally on the HVAC demand in a seaport building used as an office space. It explores the flexibility and deployment of heat pumps for emissions reductions and demand response. The office building, located in Middlesbrough, UK was modelled using sensor data on electricity consumption, fuel oil consumption, inside temperature and humidity distribution and the subjective thermal experiences of the building occupants.

This paper presents the experience of the Easylog Project – Optimized logistics for ports and intermodal transport – funded under the Interreg IT-FR Maritime 2014–2020 program. Easylog aims to improve the mobility of rolling cargo between Italian and French regions by taking advantage of ICT technologies to increase the performance of intermodal transport chains and the overall quality of the services offered by ports. The project involves five ports in the upper Tyrrhenian area for which it proposes the shared adoption of integrated ICT devices for optimized and secure management of port operations between the operators involved in the cross-border (trans)port chain. The driving idea is to move from a non-integrated and fragmented management and control system of port events and flows to a common and connected ICT system.

The existing scheduling system cannot realize the information interaction and collaborative integration between the physical world and the virtual world, while the digital twin (DT) technology can effectively solve the problem of real-time information interaction and the reinforcement learning (RL) method can cope with dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposed a DT-driven RL method to solve the marine equipment vehicle scheduling problem. Given the dynamic nature of transportation tasks, the diversity of transported goods, and the optimization characteristics of transportation requirements, a framework for scheduling transportation vehicle operations based on DT is constructed, and a RL-based vehicle scheduling method in a dynamic task environment is proposed. A Markov decision process (MDP) model of the vehicle scheduling process is established to realize one-to-one mapping between information and physical elements. An improved RL method based on Q-learning is proposed to solve the MDP model, and the value function approximation and convergence enhancement methods are applied to optimize the solving process. Finally, a case study is used for example verification to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;The motivation of this paper is to optimize material transportation vehicle scheduling in dynamic task environments and to improve logistics transportation efficiency. Therefore, a DT-based vehicle scheduling method for marine equipment is proposed. Firstly, a framework of vehicle scheduling based on DT is designed to establish a MDP model of the vehicle scheduling process, and the dynamic task characteristics are described by mathematical methods in the design of the elements of the model. A RL-based vehicle scheduling method is proposed. The value function approximation method and the convergence enhancement method of the algorithm are investigated for the characteristics of continuous dynamic action features leading to huge state space and non-convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm performance is verified and analyzed through data validation of actual cases.

With shipping and cargo handling responsible for at least 2.5% of annual carbon emissions, the maritime sector poses fertile ground for carbon reductions. This paper focuses on the use of Digital Twins for analyzing and optimizing energy consumption related to cargo handling in a seaport. Specifically, the paper focuses upon data-driven modelling and 'what-if' analysis to quantify the potential of energy regeneration capture in a seaport electrified gantry crane used for cargo handling. The crane, located in Middlesbrough, UK was modelled using real-time sensor and control system data on electricity consumption, position, velocity, and driver commands. Mean average modelling errors of less than 1 % were obtained. The dynamic model was deployed for exploration of regeneration capture from lifting operations using a simulated Active Front End (AFE) of power electronics and batteries. Using calibrated simulations, data from a cargo handling system and historical annual consumption data, the paper provides estimates of the potential energy savings for three existing electrified cranes of approximately 420 MWh per year. Using conservative estimates of 40% reclamation of energy for all hoist lifting operations, obtained via a simplified static model, further potentially significant savings are suggested to be possible through the retrofitting of additional diesel cranes. © 2022 IEEE.",cargo handling; data analytics; digital twins; Energy consumption; gantry cranes; power electronics; regeneration capture,Carbon; Data Analytics; Data handling; Energy utilization; Power electronics; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Data analytics; Data-driven model; Energy-consumption; Feasibility studies; Maritime sector; Optimizing energy; Power-electronics; Regeneration capture; Energy conservation,"Department of Transport, UK Government, DfT; Innovate UK, (10007967)",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147732506

This paper describes cyber-Attack impacts against the Smart terminal system of systems in the cyber realm by utilizing the MITRE ATTACK® framework to map the objectives of threat actors. The Smart Terminal system environment includes ICT, ICS networks and components, communication systems, and port service systems. Internal and external threat sources or actors are hard to divide exactly because of the diversity of the threats. Hybrid threats challenge maritime domain awareness globally. The cyber threat impacts on IT and OT environments are connected to each other because of the use of internal and external networks that impact each other by combining vulnerabilities and threats. Well-working port and terminal operations require not only protected operational systems or sensor systems, but human errors must also be minimized. Objectives of threat actors are presented, categorized, and listed. Threat scenarios illustrate that cyber threats and risks are mainly similar in the maritime global-linked port community and basic hinterland trade. The networked supply chain of the business causes evolving and combined threat scenarios. European and international standards, regulations, policies, recommendations, and, e.g., guidelines by the IMO, set new cyber-Threat requirements for port and terminal services and facilities. Therefore, overall security must be considered when cyber-security is the development area. Information exchange in an understandable form is essential for maintaining business continuity.

For example, the growing importance of maritime traffic in cross-border trade has created new pressures to develop new technologies for accident prevention, especially in the ports. Maritime safety is also a matter of concern for continuity management. Automatic ship alarm systems, coastal radars and coastal cameras are not alone sufficient equipment to build maritime awareness. The Universal Shipborne Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a ship transponder system that is a globally used tracking system, but highly vulnerable to hacking. A major maritime traffic problem arises if transponders are switched off. Hybrid threats need coordinated hybrid responses; therefore, a cyber situational picture is also needed. Cyber situational awareness is an essential part of the management of maritime situational awareness. The lack of using real-time data from the maritime actors affects the correct formation of the common situational picture-for example, from the site of an accident.

We pioneer a novel application of machine learning to emulate a highly complex physical-biogeochemical model to predict marine oxygen in the shelf-sea environment. The emulators are developed with intention of supporting future digital twins for two key stakeholder applications: (i) prediction of hypoxia for aquaculture and fisheries, (ii) extrapolation of oxygen from marine observations. We identify the key drivers behind oxygen concentrations and determine the constrains on observational data for a skilled prediction of marine oxygen across the whole water column. Through this we demonstrate that ML models can be very useful in informing observation measurement arrays. We compare the performance of multiple different ML models, discuss the benefits of the used approaches and identify outstanding issues, such as limitations imposed by the spatio-temporal resolution of the training/validation data.

UAVs offer several benefits, such as affordability and flexibility in deployment. However, their limited flight time due to energy consumption is one of the key limitations. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that UAVs can complete the mission while consuming the least energy possible. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for UAV smart navigation to minimize the time and energy of planning mobile targets visitation. We develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to allow the drone to learn the targets’ mobility pattern and build its least energy scanning strategy accordingly. We conduct an initial evaluation of the system and our proposed DRL model policy using simulation. Then, to overcome the time-consuming exploration phase of DRL, we develop a Digital Twin (DT) environment of 3D physics-based simulator, which can be used to train the DRL agent efficiently. We also developed a testbed based on hardware integration with the parrot ANAFI drone to verify the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Our findings confirm that the DRL-based agent can achieve performance close to that of a benchmark policy. Moreover, the testbed experiment validates the practicality of utilizing the DT environment for DRL exploration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Deep Reinforcement Learning; Digital twin; Energy minimization; Target visitation; Testbed development; UAVs,Benchmarking; Deep learning; E-learning; Energy utilization; Military applications; Testbeds; Deep reinforcement learning; Enabler technologies; Energy minimization; Least energy; Mobile targets; Reinforcement learnings; Target visitation; Testbed development; Unmanned air vehicles; Vehicle navigation; Reinforcement learning,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85154587921

Recently, the trio of COVID-19, digitalization, and decarbonization (CDD) has emerged as core challenges whilst providing numerous opportunities for building adaption and resilience for the port industry. In light of this, the sixth generation ports (6GP) model has emerged. This paper addresses crucial research gaps by empirically testing the 6GP model, emphasizing the impact of emerging factors of the CDD, including 1) the lack of empirical testing for the 6GP model and the emphasis on the CDD; 2) the exploration of factors contributing to the significant development of Chinese container ports; 3) the investigation into how the CDD lead to the reversal of the port devolution continuum path. In doing so, an empirical study has been conducted, focusing on six major container ports in mainland China, all of which are among the world's top 10 container ports in terms of container throughput. It evaluates the importance of the criteria of the 6GP model with the performance of the six ports.

The intelligent identification of ship behavior is critical for safety supervision in the waterborne transport. In particular, the complicated behavior reflects the long-term intentions of a ship, but it is challenging to recognize it automatically for computers without a proper understanding. For this purpose, this study provides a method to model the behavior for computers from the perspective of knowledge modeling that is explainable. Based on our previous work, a semantic model for ship behavior representation is given considering the multi-scale features of ship behavior in cognitive space. Firstly, the multi-scale features of ship behavior are analyzed in spatial-temporal dimension and semantic dimension individually. Then, a method for multi-scale behaviors modeling from the perspective of semantics is determined, which divides the behavior scale into four sub-scales in cognitive space, considering spatial and temporal dimensions: action, activity, process, and event. Furthermore, an ontology model is introduced to construct the multi-scale semantic model for ship behavior, where behaviors with different semantic scales are expressed using the functions of ontology from a microscopic perspective to a macroscopic perspective consecutively. To validate the model, a case study is conducted in which ship behavior with different scales occurred in port water areas. Typical behaviors, which include leveraging the axioms expression and semantic web rule language (SWRL) of the ontology, are then deduced using a reasoner, such as Pellet. The results show that the model is reasonable and feasible to represent multi-scale ship behavior in various scenarios and provides the potential to construct a smart supervision network for maritime authorities.",semantic modeling; ship behavior; cognitive space; multi-scale analysis; ontology,,China Scholarship Council [202106950002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [52072287],Article,,,,

Especially container ports experience competition not only for ships but also for supply chains. To adapt to this trend, terminal operators are improving the efficiency in port logistics through, among other things, automation of port operations. Most of these efforts concern processes handling shipped goods. Instead of concentrating on these well-researched improvements, we explored the feasibility and economic potential of an intelligent lighting control system. Often automating handling processes need high investments in hard- and software. This smart lighting system is supposed to control demand-actuated outdoor lights in a harbour environment. In this research, movement profiles of straddle carriers and infrastructural data were gathered and refined to build a model of the observed container terminal. The modelled infrastructure includes the position of every lighting tower and its illuminant as well as their specific power consumption and the respective area, which those lights illume. To control these lights, we developed a control algorithm. We investigated through simulation experiments the power savings for this autonomous lighting control system. Multiple influential factors of this control concept were evaluated by varying the parameterization of the algorithm. A gathered data set, containing trajectories of operating straddle carriers during full terminal utilization, is the basis for the mentioned experiments. The results of varying the utilization rate of the terminal have identified a relationship between capacity and percental power consumption, in the form of a root function. The more straddle carriers run, the less the overall power consumption is increasing. Using the intelligent light control system on full utilization saves 14.67% of the total energy. In the case of 80 % terminal utilization, 18.22 % of total energy is subject for saving effects. Besides these results, we were able to explore the influences of the algorithm parameterization on the energy savings and could assess these solutions economically. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Compared to the conventional diesel engines, the use of additional components to accommodate the natural gas feeding is associated with several safety implications. To ensure the engine safe operation, appropriate engine control and safety systems are of vital importance, whilst potential safety implications due to sensors and actuators faults or failures must be considered. This study aims at investigating the safety issues of a marine dual fuel (DF) engine considering critical operating scenarios, which are identified by employing a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis. An existing verified digital twin (DT) of the investigated DF engine, capable of predicting the engine response at steady state and transient conditions with sufficient accuracy is employed to simulate the engine operation for the identified scenarios. The simulated scenarios results analysis is used to support the risk priority number assessment and identify the potential safety implications by considering the manufacturer alarm limits. Appropriate measures are recommended for the investigated DF engine safety performance improvement. This study demonstrates a methodology integrating existing safety methods with state-of-the-art simulation tools for facilitating and enhancing the safety assessment process of marine DF engines considering both steady state conditions and transient operation with main focus on switching operating modes. © IMechE 2021.",actuators and sensors faults/failures; digital twins; FMECA; marine dual fuel (DF) engines; Safety analysis; simulation,Criticality (nuclear fission); Digital twin; Failure (mechanical); Fuels; Marine engines; Marine industry; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Sustainable development; Attractive solutions; Criticality analysis; Environmental footprints; Risk Priority Number; Sensors and actuators; Steady state and transients; Steady-state condition; Transient operation; Dual fuel engines,DNV AS; MSRC; RCCL,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114142895

The development of such system(s) is typically based on the manufacturers experience on sensors and actuators faults and failure events. This study aims to introduce a novel methodology for the sensors diagnostics and health management in marine dual fuel engines by employing a combination of thermodynamic, functional control and data-driven models. The concept of an Engine Diagnostics System (EDS) is developed to provide intelligent engine monitoring, advanced sensors’ faults detection as well as timely and profound corrective actions. This system employs a neural networks (NN) Data-Driven (DD) model along with appropriate logic controls. The DD model is set up based on the derived steady state data from a thermodynamic model of high fidelity and is capable of real-time prediction of the engine health condition behaviour. The concept of a novel Unified Digital System (UDS) is proposed that combines the engine’s existing control and diagnostic systems with the EDS. The functionality of the UDS system is validated by employing a digital twin of the considered marine dual fuel engine by investigating scenarios for assessing the engine performance that entail abnormalities in the engine’s speed and boost pressure sensors. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed UDS is capable of sufficiently capturing the engine’s sensors abnormalities and applying appropriate corrective actions to restore the engine operation in its original state. This study benefits the development future systems facilitating the engines condition assessment and self-correction of the engine sensors’ abnormalities, which will be required for smart and autonomous shipping. © IMechE 2021.",0D/1D modelling; data-driven model; digital twin; engine control functional systems; Marine dual fuel (DF) engines; sensor abnormalities detection and correction,Digital twin; Fault detection; Fuels; Health; Marine engines; Condition assessments; Corrective actions; Engine diagnostics; Intelligent engines; Neural network (nn); Real-time prediction; Sensors and actuators; Thermodynamic model; Dual fuel engines,DNV GL AS; RCCL,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101236961

However, such models are usually difficult to represent by linear equations. Therefore, an adequate linearization technique should be introduced. Therefore, linear models as digital twins can be interpreted easily and need much less computational power when applied to various industrial applications. On the other hand, a linearization approach can increase the respective system-model errors and impose significant constraints on the models of SoS, i.e., since linear models can be applicable only in limited operating regions. This research study aims to combine positive characteristics of both linear and nonlinear modelling into a digital twin development framework by having the properties of linear digital twin models locally while the model framework is covering the whole operating region of the SoS. An industrial application of marine engines as an SoS is considered for this study, where the respective models have been used to predict engine fuel consumption. For this purpose, firstly, a dataset is selected from a marine engine of a selected ocean-going vessel. Then, several localized linear operational regions of the respective data set are identified using an unsupervised data-driven technique, i.e., on the engine propeller combinator diagram. For developing the localized models: firstly, the Gaussian Mixture Models method is used to cluster the data points into different operational regions of the engine propeller combinator diagram. Then, a nonlinear model of the relationship between features is developed in each cluster using the polynomial regression approach. Then, these models are combined using the Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) method to create an overall model for the marine engine as an SoS. The same model is utilized to predict the respective fuel consumption based on engine operational conditions. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

However, its maintenance has become a problem for a long time due to its complexity and vulnerability. Although the semi-physical marine engine room simulator fails frequently, its failures are usually small-scale communication failures, which are easy to solve for experts. For such kind of micro faults, the cost of field maintenance by experts is very high due to the long journey. Generally, most manufactures will choose to assist the users' maintenance by telephone or email firstly. If it does not work, they will have to send experts for field maintenance which is expensive for users. In this paper, we propose a digital twin architecture of the semi-physical marine engine room simulator to assist users in remote maintenance. The digital twin system is a multi-twins architecture consisting of the user digital twin and the manufacturer digital twin. The user digital twin is a technical guidance platform for information reception and display, through which the user can get technical adviser from the experts in the 3D virtual environment. The manufacture digital twin is a platform for monitoring and troubleshooting by experts. The communication faults are the main faults of the semi-physical marine engine room simulator, which are easy to monitor. Consequently, it is possible to realize remote maintenance assistance through the digital twin system without a lot of time cost and economic cost.  © 2021 IEEE.",Digital twin; Remote maintenance; Simulator,Maintenance; Manufacture; Marine engines; Personnel training; Virtual reality; 3-D virtual environment; Communication failure; Economic costs; Long journey; Marine engine room simulators; Remote maintenance; Small scale; Technical advisors; Technical guidances; Time cost; Simulators,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126466970

Furthermore, the study delves into the assessment of risks in smart port supply chains, employing an innovative approach that integrates rough set theory and neural networks. This novel model significantly improves the accuracy of risk evaluation in port supply chains, thereby providing crucial decision support for port management.

The mean value engine model (MVEM) is investigated with three different compressor mass flow rate models: a 2D interpolation model (2D), an experience-based M-JENSEN (MJ) model, and a physics-based Kang Song (KS) model. Each model is studied on a MAN 7S80ME engine with ABB A270 turbochargers. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE) for the test data are approximately 2.5 m3/s for the 2D model, 2.8 m3/s for the KS model, and 0.56 m3/s for the MJ model. For the training data, the RMSEs are around 0.0, 3.0, and 0.69 m3/s, respectively. When coupling each model to the MVEM, it is observed that the calculated values differ only in the turbocharger speed. The RMREs under steady-state processes are 0.54% for MVEM with the 2D model, 1.63% for MVEM with the KS model, and 0.48% for MVEM with the MJ model. Under dynamic processes where the engine load is changed from 100% to 80%, the RMREs are 1.59%, 2.40%, and 1.58%, respectively. Among the studied models, the 2D model exhibits instability, the MJ model shows the highest accuracy, while the KS model performs the worst. However, all models demonstrate comparable results when used in the MVEM. Moreover, the physics-based KS model is a favorable choice for digital twin applications due to its excellent extrapolation ability and low dependence on measured data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers (JASNAOE) 2023.",Compressor; Diesel engine; Digital twin; Jensen model; Marine; Mass flow rate; Mean value; Model; MVEM; Turbocharger,Compressors; Flow rate; Marine engines; Mass transfer; Mean square error; Ships; Turbomachinery; 2-D model; Flow rate modeling; Jensen models; Marine; Marine Diesel Engines; Mass-flow rate; Mean value engine modeling; Mean values; Physics-based; Turbocharger; Diesel engines,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071090); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M690495); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB4301400, CBG3N21-3-3); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175614975

Methods of modeling play a key role. As years passed, JENSEN model has been widely used in turbocharged diesel engines for calculating the mass flow rate of centrifugal compressor of turbocharger. However, it is difficult to get good accuracy and a good convergence performance at the same time. For the first time, we propose a model, called M-JENSEN, which has been validated to be of good accuracy and well convergence performance at the same time. The optimal objective of Jensen’s model is the dimensionless pressure head, while the volume flow rate is what the user wants in practice. This difference makes the accuracy loss in Jensen’s model. An attempt has been made to change the optimal objective; the accuracy was improved but convergence was hard to reach. Thus, a modified version of Jensen’s model, M-JENSEN, was proposed by swapping the position of Mach number and dimensionless pressure head. Compared to Jensen’s model, the accuracy of M-JENSEN model was improved by 29.5% measured by R-square and 52.3% measured by RMSE in ABB A270. Its performance was also validated in MAN TCA88 and showed consistent results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.",Centrifugal compressor; Diesel engine; Flow rate; Jensen; Marine; Modeling; Turbocharger,Centrifugal compressors; Centrifugation; Flow rate; Marine engines; Turbomachinery; Convergence performance; Jensen; Marine; Marine Diesel Engines; Modeling; Pressure heads; S models; Turbocharger; Validated methods; Volume flow rate; Diesel engines,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071090); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M690495); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (017200221); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144623784

During a PSC inspection, PSC officers (PSCOs) identify ship deficiencies that lead to a ship's detention, which can cause severe economic and reputational losses to the ship operator. Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators' decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.",Prescriptive analytics; Data -driven optimization; Port state control (PSC) inspection; Ship maintenance planning,PORT STATE CONTROL; BERTH ALLOCATION; MAINTENANCE; LOGISTICS; ANALYTICS; ALGORITHM; MODEL,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72071173, 71831008]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [15201121]",Article,,,,

The airship is designed accordingly to the specifications, which have been analyzed in terms of the required CONOPS (Concepts of Operations) which are associated with the proposed High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) technology and special operations and to analyze the operational scenarios. An innovative cruiser feeder system is defined and studied. The CONOPS includes communications relays, support of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition monitor ""mobile targets"", and reconnaissance, including long-range ISTAR missions performed by the feeder, combining satellite vision and HAPS vision for a forest fire, disasters, naval accidents, maritime and ground borders. The paper realizes a multidisciplinary analysis that allows creating the design of the HAPS, referring to both cruiser and feeder in different operative scenarios. It is expected to produce the preliminary basis for a future digital twin based design to generate the best possible configuration by mean of implementing multiphysics simulations. Structured object-oriented design processes involve developing several different system models and configurations. The modular design of the core modules is necessary for both ensuring the adequate performances, the capability of satisfying the operative necessities which have been defined by the CONOPS and fulfilling the requirements. © 2020 SAE International.

Historically, substantially empirical design by trial and error and the inherent overdesign that this produces, combined with the use of robust materials, mean that eighteenth-and nineteenth-century port structures have sometimes lasted well. Without change in use or reduction in maintenance, they may continue to perform well. However, with the widespread use of reinforced concrete and steel sheet piles starting c. 100 years ago, the introduction of the concept of 'design life' was necessary. The structural ability and cost-effectiveness of maintenance of these more sensitive structures steadily decrease as the maritime degradation processes take hold. This paper considers the ever-increasing risk of infrastructure failure that the UK port industry faces and suggests the need for a considered and smart approach to the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of port assets. Examples of smart, real-time, remote monitoring technologies are discussed as the tools for port owners to avoid costly, and potentially uninsured, infrastructure failures.","corrosion; ports, docks & harbours; seivice life",,,Article,,,,

The proposed maturity model evaluates these main aspects in six areas of interest, providing maturity indexes that enable identifying the current state of intelligence in a port terminal, hence aiding its improvement. The application of the maturity model in two Brazilian container terminals provided feedback to the theoretical proposition and supports its use as a tool for general assessment of smart port terminal maturity.

In the maritime domain, conventional approaches have relied on mathematical modeling (e.g., linearised equations of motion) and heavy computations for estimating ship resistance and propulsion, seakeeping and maneuverability and overall hull form optimization, treating the vessel as a point body. For instance, the ability to predict a vessel's future track in confined or congested waters presents a significant challenge due to the fact that as time passes, these models often fall out of sync with their digital counterparts due to changes that happen to the ship (e.g., foulding affecting maneuverability). In addition to this, mostly due to computational resources required, in real world deployments models are simplified, thus reducing their overall prediction accuracy. In our work, we implement AI-enabled coupled abstractions of the asset-twin system, which rely on machine learning methods for constant learning of the evolving over time behavior of a vessel based on historical trip data and information related to vessel's structure and loading capacity. The evaluation results indicate that the inclusion of vessel and journey specific information is beneficial for the predictions.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

This study aims at developing a framework to address the health assessment of marine engines utilising digital twins based on first-principles. This framework follows four distinct stages, with the former two including the marine engine digital-twin set up by customising the required thermodynamic models, as well as its calibration using tests trials data representing the engine healthy conditions. In the third stage, measurements from actual operating conditions are corrected and subsequently employed to develop the digital twin representing the prevailing conditions. The fourth stage deals with the engine health assessment by assessing health metrics derived from the developed digital twins. This framework is demonstrated in a case study of a large marine four-stroke nine-cylinder propulsion engine. The results demonstrate that three cylinders are identified to be underperforming leading to an average increase of the engine Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) by 2.1%, whereas an average decreases of 6.8% in Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and 6.1% in the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) are exhibited for the underperforming cylinders across the entire operating envelope. The developed digital twins facilitate the effective mapping of the engine performance for the entire operating envelope under several health conditions, providing enhanced insights for the current engine health status. The advantages of the proposed framework include the use of easily obtained data, and its application to several engine types including two and four-stroke engines for both propulsion and auxiliary use. © IMechE 2023.",digital twins; engine health assessment; engine performance maps; Marine engine; measurements correction; model calibration; thermodynamic modelling,Engine cylinders; Safety engineering; Condition; Engine health assessment; Engine performance; Engine performance map; Health assessments; Machine-learning; Measurement corrections; Model calibration; Performance maps; Thermodynamic modelling; Marine engines,"Innovate UK, (99958)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146629238

The actual structural condition of existing marine platforms can often change after several years in operation due to degradation mechanisms and/or other structural changes. It is within this context, the true digital twin concept has been developed and the general idea is to create a coupling between the digital twin and measurements. The measurements are performed by Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS). This coupling facilitates a direct performance evaluation of the digital twin against measurements and most importantly creates the basis for improving the performance of the digital twin to accurately capture the actual condition of the structure, and thus become a true digital twin. The full concept of creating a true digital twin encompass novel advanced analysis methods ranging from linear system identification, expansion processes, Bayesian FE model updating, wave load calibration, quantification of uncertainties from measured data, and Risk- and Reliability Based Inspection Planning (RBI) analysis, [1].

Albeit not posing as a replacement to conventional estimations, such as from Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - which solve equations in order of millions - and experimental tests - with its time-consuming preparation setups and postanalyses - the method can possibly present itself as a convenient and quicky technique to estimate the hydrodynamics coefficients in real time, as each iteration resorts only into a few dozen of equations.

One way the country is focusing on achieving this goal is by making its domestic ferries emit zero emissions. To this end, the use of electrified and battery-powered vessels is being explored, especially for short sea shipping. A life cycle analysis of diesel-powered ships and battery-powered ships for five different energy sources for electricity generation was carried out using the GABI 2020 software. The results showed that the environmental friendliness of a vessel depends on the primary source of electricity generation. While electrified ships can be environmentally friendly, they are not necessarily better than diesel-powered ships, particularly if the source of electricity is coal or heavy fuel oil. Based on the data obtained from the Philippines, transitioning to battery-powered ships necessitates the expansion of the national grid and the utilization of natural gas as an interim solution, while focusing on renewable energy sources for the medium and long term. Sustainable infrastructures such as shore power and smart grids in ports are crucial during this transition.

It is demonstrated that measuring and analyzing the engine's vibrational diagrams in parallel with gas pressure diagrams in the cylinders allows the evaluation of the actual fuel injection and gas distribution timings. The obtained data is used to refine the mathematical model of the engine's working process, which determines the engine's indicator parameters and power, as well as the emission of harmful substances that need to be monitored in compliance with current IMO requirements. The authors have accumulated experience in using the discussed hardware-based methods for diagnosing marine engines during operation. The discussed hardware and software methods are used in the educational process at the engineering faculty of the marine university, as they provide a detailed analysis of the main components of the engine's working process: the combustion process in the cylinder, the fuel injection process, and the gas distribution process. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Naturally, this has caught the interest of the maritime industry and the development of autonomous vessels. However, unlike the highway, the ocean is considered a complex environment carrying unpredictable environmental forces, such as current, waves and wind-condition. For autonomous path-following and path-planning, particularly within the machine learning-field, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have generally been the favored approach. This follows from the fact that resulting models have demonstrated staggering performance. However, for practical implementations, Deep learning-based models are generally considered black box-solutions, and hence often introduce uncertainties in the operating domain. Therefore, in this paper an autonomous path-planner based on Supervised learning is proposed. Different Supervised learning models were investigated, and Gradient Boosting Regressor was found to be the most adequate model based on hyperparameter-tuning. The model was developed on constraints proposed by the class society DNV GL combined with International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs) rule 14 for collision-avoidance. Following this, the model was trained to design a suitable path based on parametrization of a cubic Bézier curve. To follow the parametrized path, a maneuvering-controller derived from the Maneuvering problem presented in Skjetne (2005) was applied. However, a drawback of Supervised learning is the necessity for large-scale training data. Hence, a digital twin of the own vessel was developed and utilized to generate sufficient training data. To demonstrate the performance of the autonomous path-planner, a number of simulation scenarios were introduced. © 2021 The Authors.",Autonomy; Collision avoidance; COLREGs; Digital twin; Maneuvering; Path-planning; Supervised learning,Deep learning; E-learning; Maneuverability; Motion planning; Reinforcement learning; Supervised learning; Unmanned surface vehicles; Autonomy; Collisions avoidance; COLREG; Complex environments; Environmental forces; Maneuvering; Maritime industry; Path planners; Performance; Training data; Collision avoidance,"Senter for Autonome Marine Operasjoner og Systemer, AMOS; Norges Forskningsråd, (223254)",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120910149

The infrastructure, named the OceanLab subsea node, allows remote experimentation for three groups of assets: seabed infrastructure, surface or subsea vehicles/robots, and assets at remote experimentation sites. To achieve this task, a shoreside control room serves as a hub that enables efficient and diverse communication with assets in the field as well as with remote participants/operators. Remote experimentation has become more popular in recent years due to technological developments and convenience, the COVID-19 pandemic, and travel restrictions that were imposed. This situation has shown us that physical presence at the experimentation site is not necessarily the only option. Sharing of the infrastructure among different experts, which are geographically distributed, but participating in a single, local, real-time experiment, increases the level of expertise available and the efficiency of the operations. This paper also elaborates on the development of a virtual experimentation environment that includes simulators and digital twins of various marine vehicles, infrastructures, and the operational marine environment. By leveraging remote and virtual experimentation technologies, users and experts can achieve relevant results in a shorter time frame and at a reduced cost. © 2023 by the authors.",digital twins; marine robotics; remote access; simulation; virtual experimentation,,"CAROS; NTNU VISTA Centre for Autonomous Robotic Operations Subsea; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101037643); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Norges Forskningsråd",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175181674

Unfortunately, measures like the EEDI, EEXI, SEEMP and CII do not account for the operational and environmental uncertainty of operations at sea, even though they do provide a first means of evaluating the carbon footprint of ships. The increasing availability of high-frequency operational data offers the opportunity to quantify and account for this uncertainty in energy performance predictions. Current methods to evaluate and predict energy performance at a whole energy system level do not sufficiently account for operational and environmental uncertainty. In this work, we propose a digital twin that accurately predicts the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of the hybrid propulsion system of an Ocean-going Patrol Vessel (OPV) of the Royal Netherlands Navy under the aggregate effect of operational and environmental uncertainty. It combines first-principle steady-state models with machine learning algorithms to reach an accuracy of less than 5% MAPE on both mechanical and electrical propulsion, while bringing a 40% to 50% improvement over a model that does not utilise machine learning algorithms. Results over actual voyage intervals indicate a prediction accuracy of consumed fuel and carbon intensity within 2.5% accounting for a confidence interval of 95%. Finally, the direct comparison between mechanical and electrical propulsion showed no clear energy-saving benefits and a strong dependency of the results on each voyage's specific operational and environmental conditions. © 2023 The Author(s)",Carbon intensity; Data-driven methods; Digital twin; Environmental uncertainties; Hybrid propulsion; Operational uncertainties,Netherlands; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Ship propulsion; Ships; Carbon intensity; Data-driven methods; Energy performance; Environmental uncertainty; Hybrid propulsion; Machine learning algorithms; Mechanical and electrical; Mechanical propulsion; Operational uncertainty; Uncertainty; algorithm; data set; frequency analysis; machine learning; maritime transportation; uncertainty analysis; vessel; Carbon footprint,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (ALWTW.016.042)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173134742

A successful autonomous vessel depends on a sophisticated degree of situational awareness facilitated by sensors. We are investigating sub-THz radar sensors for this purpose, with the primary goal being the characterization of sea clutter and targets in terms of both amplitude and Doppler statistics at frequencies spanning 24 to 350 GHz, where presently there is a lack of data. Sub-THz frequencies are of particular interest due to improved range and Doppler resolutions, and reduced sensor size, factors expected to be critical in enabling anomaly detection in the dynamic marine environment. As part of this work, a new 207 GHz frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar is being developed for the collection of clutter and target phenomenology data. The architecture uses a direct digital synthesis (DDS) generated chirp which is upconverted onto a low phase noise microwave LO then frequency multiplied by 24 to the carrier frequency. Twin Gaussian optics lens antennas (GOLAs) are used for transmit and receive with beamwidths of 2 degrees, with adjustable linear polarization. The radar head is gimbal mounted for raster scanning RCS maps or for use in staring mode Doppler measurements. A chirp bandwidth of 4 GHz enables range bins of a few centimeters and high speed chirps enable a maximum unambiguous velocity of +/- 5 m/s.",G-band; FMCW radar; Doppler radar; radar sea clutter; target characterization,TREES,UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/S032851/1]; EPSRC [EP/S032851/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Conference paper,,,,

More current information and computer technologies are being used on cargo and passenger ships to save on operational costs and increase navigational safety. Along with the growing reliance on automation, the risk of a disruption to a vessel's critical systems by drawing on the wrong inputs from sensors to change the behaviour of the actuators has significantly increased. Traditional operational technological systems are much more complicated to update than the automatic software updates we see in information technology systems. To better understand existing cyber threats in the maritime sector and increase cybersecurity resilience, this paper aims to replicate the digital components of a ship's bridge to examine scenarios when the bridge system loses connectivity, receives the wrong inputs from sensors, or the internal system becomes compromised. The simulator differentiates fundamentally from traditional simulators or digital twins in the maritime sector that focus on training seafarers. This environment generates data streams that are similar to those on board a ship. Those data streams can be analysed, modified and spoofed to observe the effects. The effects can be technical but it is equally necessary to analyse how human beings would react in specific circumstances. Our work provides the opportunity to isolate the ship network traffic, conduct penetration testing, find cybersecurity vulnerabilities on devices, and execute cyber attacks without the dangers associated with running such scenarios on a vessel in the open sea.",maritime; cybersecurity; testbed,,,Conference paper,,,,

The methodology is demonstrated with a transition piece of an offshore wind turbine and a composite rotor blade, with surface paint damage and subsurface delamination damage, respectively. Artificial Intelligence and color threshold segmentation are used to classify and localize damages from optical images taken by drones. These damages are digitalized and mapped to a 3D geometry reconstruction of the large-scale structure or a CAD model of the structure. To map the images from 2D to 3D, metadata information is combined with the geo placement of the large-scale structure's 3D model. The 3D model can here both be a CAD model of the structure or a 3D reconstruction based on photogrammetry. After mapping the damage, the Digital Twin gives an accurate representation of the structure. The location, shape, and size of the damage are visible on the Digital Twin.

However, creation of such simulation models requires significant time and effort. In this paper, the application of deterministic identification techniques on a DC-electric ship drive train is explored as an alternative for data-driven identification techniques that require extensive measured data sets collected over long periods of ship operation. First, a nonlinear and a linear simulation model that represent the dynamic behavior of the propulsion plant are developed, and the main parameters to be identified are defined. Then, a set of experiments on a model scale boat in the bollard pull condition are conducted using an ad hoc experimental setup and data acquisition system. Subsequently, various types of identification techniques are applied, aiming to determine the unknown model parameters. Eventually, a comparison is made between experimental and simulated results, using the different sets of the estimated parameters. The value of the demonstrated approaches lies in the fast determination of unknown system parameters. These parameters can be used in simulation models, which in turn can be used for various purposes such as system controller development and tuning. Furthermore, periodic determination of system parameters can support condition monitoring to detect faults or degradation of the system. The latter point directly deals with the condition-based maintenance issue; in fact, monitoring the propulsion plant parameters over time could allow for better management (and timing) of maintenance. Although the developed ideas are far from ready to be used on the full-scale, the authors believe that the methodologies are promising enough to be developed further towards a full-scale application. © 2021 by the authors.

The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2019 by the authors.",Anti-submarine warfare (ASW); Bayesian inference; Data assimilation; Digital twin; Online sensor control; Random finite set (RFS); Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC),,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61374185)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070462663

However, 3D automatic reconstruction of dynamic targets remains a challenging task in the 3D object perception systems. In this paper, we present an innovative GAN-based deep learning neural network for 3D ship reconstruction. The method is able to reconstruct 3D ship models from single view images or videos using shape prior knowledge and a vessel generative adversarial network (Vessel-GAN), which can effectively extract the ship shape features from the single-view images or videos. Furthermore, a 3D feature network optimization model is proposed for loop optimization of 3D ship shape perception. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a high resolution single ship dataset (HSSD) was created, and the performance of the proposed method was evaluated against the existing methods, The experimental results show that the Vessel Segment Network (VSNet) can improve the accuracy of the HSSD dataset by 2.5% in the single ship segmentation tasks. In addition, Vessel-GAN was demonstrated to be able to generate multi-view ship images with an impressive FID value of 5.82. Moreover, our model can improve the accuracy of 3D ship modeling by 8.9% on the ShapeNet dataset. This innovative approach promises to enable 3D perception of the marine environment for autonomous ship.

However, the fierce environmental problems associated with human activities and economic development cannot be neglected. To systematically analyze the research status and development trend of the maritime industry, this paper collects and reviews literature from Elsevier ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases related to green shipping management and green port construction. Future research directions are presented based on the analysis. The results show that green shipping management focus on solving practical emission reduction problems. Most work of green port construction establish mathematical optimization models aiming at minimizing total operation costs or maximizing profits. Designing efficient algorithms is a research hotspot in operation management. By comparing the technical measures, operational strategy, and market-based measures, we found technical innovation is the ultimate way for the maritime industry to realize net zero-emission. Support from governments and organizations is the insurance of green development.

Most container terminals in port are generally more automated than other terminals, so it is easier to promote the informatization construction of automated terminals. Through digital twin technology, a container terminal in port can be simulated into a complete system with different combinations of layout, equipment and technology, which can realize real-time monitoring, optimize business processes and bring huge economic benefits. In short, digital twin technology has become an important factor in promoting the development of container terminal. In this paper, digital twin technology is applied to the business of container terminal. Meanwhile, the business processes of container terminal are sorted out according to production factors, production information and production tasks. Then a digital twin model modeling method for container terminal from the three dimensions of element, behavior and rule is proposed to realize the virtual simulation of container terminal. The modeling process of element model, behavior model and rule model in port is elaborated in detail.

This article investigates the automatic berthing control of an MASS subject to model uncertainties and ocean disturbances. An anti-disturbance parallel control architecture is proposed for the automatic berthing of an MASS. At the motion planning level, a digital twin model for the physical MASS is first established based on a neural-network state predictor method. Then, a model-predictive berthing planner is proposed to plan a smooth trajectory based on the digital twin model for automatic berthing. At the motion control level, a line-of-sight guidance law and a parallel anti- disturbance control law are proposed such that the MASS is able to track the planned berthing trajectory and achieve automatic berthing. It is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable.

Container terminals are increasingly adopting automated solutions to meet the challenge of larger ships, taller cranes and bigger call sizes.

Therefore, designing an automated container terminal is no longer just a matter of acquiring the right port equipment and integrating the equipment with basic terminal operating systems (TOSs), it is becoming more of designing and implementing a complete smart automated system. Smart automation would enable Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) used in container terminals to automatically adapt to changing circumstances, optimizing performance and output.

The Digital Twin will relate ecosystem services with economic indicators and show amongst others; the potential biodiversity increase, CO2 sequestration, oxygen level increase and corresponding revenues. It can track the impact and continuously demonstrate progress and status by integrating 3rd party monitoring and data collection methods. Worldwide offshore energy systems develop more and more towards multi-use, which is key to enhancing seabed biodiversity. The opportunities for multi-use are endless, but the inclusion of ecosystem restoration can only be successful if the right data is collected and insights can be shown. If we can better understand the system in which the intervention is taking place, we can better make the right decisions. An intelligent tool to create high traction and impact on marine ecosystems at scale, as it facilitates energy companies and operators to evaluate targeted and high-value environmental solutions. It will break down the complex challenge of biodiversity, and allows for easy and impactful decision-making on this topic. This will release pressure on specific species, and nature in general, and will allow them to thrive again. Efforts to enhance ecosystem services, combined with AI-driven insights, unleash a new sea of opportunities for nature inclusive works. Currently under development in collaboration with universities and research institutes, our aim with this paper is to inspire and invite marine industry partners to join our upscaling efforts. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,Biodiversity; Economics; Ecosystems; Marine biology; Molluscs; Offshore oil well production; Restoration; Decision-making systems; Decisions makings; Ecosystem restoration; Ecosystem services; Energy demands; Environmental information; Environmental requirement; Large-scales; Ocean ecosystems; Project site; Decision making,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176807619

However, smart shipping is at the preliminary stage, and the related literature on smart shipping systems or domains is still lacking. To understand and develop smart shipping, our study intends to establish an index system based on the literature review and the Delphi method. Consequently, the system, which includes four first-level indexes, 17 second-level indexes, and 61 third-level indexes, is established. As the main domains, smart waterways, smart ports, smart ships, and maritime intelligence compose the smart shipping system. Among these four domains, the coordinated opinion of experts proposes that smart ports are very important for achieving smart shipping.

The dynamic and complex nature of marine environments makes accurate prediction of mooring line tension a formidable task. Existing deep learning models, constrained by the data distribution of their training sets, typically perform well within the scope of these datasets. However, their limited generalization capability becomes apparent when confronted with unknown and changing marine conditions, resulting in a decline in prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Domain Generalization (DG) model approach, which incorporates a distribution matching regularization term to the model's loss function, aimed at reducing distributional disparities between data from different domains. The proposed method was compared with existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) model method through validation with engineering case studies. The results indicate that the DG model method significantly surpasses the DNN model in terms of generalization capabilities. The mooring line tension prediction model developed herein holds potential for constructing digital twins, offering near real-time data support for moored floating engineering projects.

Based on the findings and insights obtained from the bibliometric and systematic review, the development of a resilient maritime transportation system could be facilitated by means of data- or intelligence-driven technologies, such as scenario representation, digital twinning, and data simulation.

Given that maritime authorities often have limited inspection resources, we proposed three two-step approaches that match the inspection resources with the ships, aimed at identifying the most deficiencies (non-compliances with regulations) of the ships. The first approach predicts the number of deficiencies in each deficiency category for each ship and then develops an integer optimization model that assigns the inspectors to the ships to be inspected. The second approach predicts the number of deficiencies each inspector can identify for each ship and then applies an integer optimization model to assign the inspectors to the ships to be inspected. The third approach is a semi-smart predict then optimize (semi-SPO) method. It also predicts the number of deficiencies each inspector can identify for each ship and uses the same integer optimization model as the second approach, however, instead of minimizing the mean squared error as in the second approach, it adopts a loss function motivated by the structure of the optimization problem in the second approach. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approaches improve the current inspection efficiency by over 4% regarding the total number of detected deficiencies. Through comprehensive sensitivity analysis, several managerial insights are generated and the robustness of the proposed approaches is validated. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Promoting the low-carbon transition of ports by using clean energy is effective. Using hydrogen energy in automated container terminals (ACTs) has become popular in port emission-reduction research. The research object is the main port equipment—the automated rail-mounted container gantry crane (ARMG). This research designs a staged investment decision-making scheme for ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. The Internet of Things (IoT) architecture in ACTs collects ARMG equipment operation and carbon emission data. It provides a basis for data acquisition in ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. Furthermore, ports can adopt big data technology to analyze the correlation between equipment operation and carbon emissions. Finally, the digital twin platform will visualize the ARMG equipment operation and carbon emission behavior to remote operators. These advanced technologies can achieve status monitoring and simulation prediction, which will support ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. However, the ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition has a long cycle, large investment, and strong variability. Ports should make staged investment decisions based on the digital twin platform’s status monitoring and simulation prediction analysis results. Therefore, this research establishes an optimization model for ARMGs’ low-carbon transition investment decision based on the real options method, and analyzes the staged investment scale and timing of ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. The results provide a popularized decision-making scheme for the low-carbon transition of ports’ equipment, which could facilitate the low-carbon transition of ports’ equipment. © 2022 by the authors.",ARMGs; investment decision; low-carbon transition; real options,Carbon; Data acquisition; Decision making; Emission control; Internet of things; Investments; Simulation platform; ARMG; Automated container terminals; Carbon emissions; Decision-based; Emission reduction; Energy transitions; Hydrogen Energy; Investment decisions; Low-carbon transitions; Real Options; Containers,"Social Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, (L20BGL056)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136259001

Unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned surface vessels, combat robots, and other new intelligent weapons and equipment will play an essential role on future battlefields by performing various tasks, including situational reconnaissance, monitoring, attack, and communication relay. Real-time monitoring of maritime scenes is the basis of battle-situation and threat estimation in naval battlegrounds. However, images of maritime scenes are usually accompanied by haze, clouds, and other disturbances, which blur the images and diminish the validity of their contents. This will have a severe adverse impact on many downstream tasks. A novel large kernel encoder–decoder network with multihead pyramids (LKEDN-MHP) is proposed to address some maritime image dehazing-related issues. The LKEDN-MHP adopts a multihead pyramid approach to form a hybrid representation space comprising reflection, shading, and semanteme. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the LKEDN-MHP uses many kernels with a 7 × 7 or larger scale to extract features. To reduce the computational burden, depthwise (DW) convolution combined with re-parameterization is adopted to form a hybrid model stacked by a large number of different receptive fields, further enhancing the hybrid receptive fields. To restore the natural hazy maritime scenes as much as possible, we apply digital twin technology to build a simulation system in virtual space. The final experimental results based on the evaluation metrics of the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, Jaccard index, and Dice coefficient show that our LKEDN-MHP significantly enhances dehazing and real-time performance compared with those of state-of-the-art approaches based on vision transformers (ViTs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). © 2022 by the authors.",digital twin; image dehazing; large kernel encoder–decoder network; multihead pyramids; re-parameterization,,"Department of Education of Liaoning Province, (2021-KF-12-05, LG202107); Shenyang Science and Technology Bureau, (RC200386); Program for Liaoning Innovative Talents in University, (LR2019058); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program, (XLYC1902095)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140778736

However, it has grown against the trend in unmanned distribution and online consumption. In recent years, the maritime industry has gradually introduced artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things, and big data. Through literature review and expert interviews, this research figures out the development status of smart ports at home and abroad and the digital development barriers of ports and then uses the Fuzzy Delphi and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process method to identify three dimensions and thirteen key factors target companies. The survey targets shipping companies, shipping agencies, and port management companies. The paper conducted the questionnaires to identify the critical success factors of port digitization. It was found that the “digital solutions” dimension had the highest weight value among the three dimensions and the top five critical factors in the overall ranking were based on the order of “carbon emission management,” “enhancing port safety”, “technology standardization,” “digital asset management,” and “optimization of the supply chain.” The result of this study can help port operators and shipping companies identify critical success factors of smart ports and adopt port digital development strategies for operation efficiency improvement and climate change mitigation. © 2024 World Conference on Transport Research Society",Critical success factors; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy Delphi method; Port digitalization,analytical hierarchy process; climate change; digitization; environmental factor; fuzzy mathematics; port; ranking; shipping; transportation development,"National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (NSTC 112-2410-H-992-056); National Science and Technology Council, NSTC",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195049486

However, waterway depth data measured during actual maritime navigation is limited, and the depth values can have large variability. Big data collected in real time by automatic identification systems (AIS) might provide a way to estimate accurate waterway depths, although these data include no direct channel depth information. We suggest a deep neural network (DNN) based model, called DDTree, for using the real-time AIS data and the data from Global Mapper to predict waterway depth for ships in an accurate and timely way. The model combines a decision tree and DNN, which is trained and tested on the AIS and Global Mapper data from the Nantong and Fangcheng ports on the southeastern and southwestern coast of China. The actual waterway depth data were used together with the AIS data as the input to DDTree. The latest data on waterway depths from the Chinese maritime agency were used to verify the results. The experiments show that the DDTree model has a prediction accuracy of 91.15%. Therefore, the DDTree model can provide an accurate prediction of waterway depth and compensate for the shortage of waterway depth monitoring means. The proposed hybrid DDTree model could improve marine situational awareness, navigation safety, and shipping efficiency, and contribute to smart navigation.",marine navigation safety; depth prediction; hybrid model; deep learning; smart navigation,SIMULATION,"National key R&D Program of China [2018YFB1402700]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province [2018ZDXM-GY-036]; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Intelligent Processing for Big Energy Data [IPBED7]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61761042, 61941112]; Key Research and Development Program of Yanan [2017KG-01, 2017WZZ-04-01]",Article,,,,

Since the inspection resources are limited and the inspection process is costly and time-consuming, a critical issue for port states to guarantee inspection efficiency is to accurately select ships with a high risk for inspection. To address this issue, this study proposes three prediction models to predict the ship deficiency number and a ship selection optimization model based on the prediction results to target the riskiest ships for inspection. In addition to a linear regression model for ship deficiency number prediction solved by the least squares method, we establish two prediction models with the pairwise-comparison target based semi-smart predict then optimize (semi-SPO) method. Specifically, a linear programming model and a support vector machine (SVM) model are built and both have a loss function to minimize the sum of predicted ranking errors of each pair of ships regarding their deficiency numbers.

Smart ports, as high performing ports, utilize information and communications technology (ICT) to provide a wide range of smart applications, resulting in vastly improved vessels and container management among others, which subsequently improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the national economy. While various novel solutions, such as information system and locating system, have been proposed to improve smart port activities, there are several key issues pertaining to ports and port operations that warrant specific attention, particularly greenhouse gases emission, which has accelerated to an alarming level. The urgent need to address such issues is lacking. This article aims to offer a review of the research literature on smart ports, including Internet of Things platform, greenhouse gases emission reduction, energy efficiency enhancement, and so on. The objective is to establish a foundation of existing research conducted on smart ports in order to motivate new research interests in this area.

Governments are committed to transforming their ports into smart ports because of the potential benefits, such as more efficient operation from information and communication technologies and the internet of things. A smart port can also save energy and manage environmental impacts to achieve sustainable development. This research investigates how smart port design can influence the efficiency of maritime transport with a three-step DEA-Tobit modeling procedure. First, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to evaluate port operating performance. Second, to investigate the influence of smart port design, three smart port aspects are identified: automation, environment and intelligence. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the importance of each aspect. Finally, a Tobit regression modeling approach is constructed to evaluate how the weighted smart port aspects influence operating efficiency. This study uses the top 20 maritime ports based on their throughputs as the case study. Model results show the various influence of the three aspects. Pollution control from the environment aspect has the largest positive impact on port efficiency. On the contrary, information sharing from the intelligence aspect has a negative impact on efficiency which might be due to technology requirements, information overload and information process complexity. This study defines the smart port concepts that are integrated into port performance evaluation process. Model results confirm not all the design elements bring positive impacts. This is also the main contribution of this study that proposed an integrated measurement structure to investigate the influence and impact of the smart port concept. Finally, this study concludes with policy implications to prioritize smart aspects and indicators for policy makers and operators to help develop smart ports. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Analytic hierarchy process; Data envelopment analysis; DEA-Tobit; Operating efficiency; Smart port; Tobit regression,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (109-2221-E-009-047-MY3, 109-2410-H-009-027)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134148595

In this new era of intelligent infrastructure and facilities, it is evident that cyber-security has recently received the most significant attention from the seaport and maritime authorities, and it is a primary concern on the agenda of most ports. Traditional security solutions like firewalls and antivirus software can be applied to safeguard IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) from harmful entities. Nevertheless, security researchers can only watch, examine, and learn about the behaviors of attackers if these solutions operate more transparently. Herein, honeypots are potential solutions since they offer valuable information about the attackers. Honeypots can be virtual or physical. Virtual honeypots must be more realistic to entice attackers, necessitating better high-fidelity. To this end, Digital Twin (DT) technology can be employed to increase the complexity and simulation fidelity of the honeypots. Seaports can be attacked from both their existing devices and external devices at the same time. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect external attacks; therefore, the current systems cannot handle attacks at the desired level. DT and honeypot technologies can be used together to tackle them. Consequently, we suggest a DT-assisted honeypot, called TwinPot, for external attacks in smart seaports. Moreover, we propose an intelligent attack detection mechanism to handle different attack types using DT technology for internal attacks. Finally, we build an extensive smart seaport dataset for internal and external attacks using the MANSIM tool and two existing datasets to test the performance of our system. We show that under both simultaneous internal and external attacks on the system, our solution successfully detects internal and external attacks. © 2023 IEEE.",DT; Honeypot; IoT; Seaport; Smart Ports,Computer system firewalls; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Network security; Statistical tests; Antivirus softwares; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems; Detection mechanism; Honeypots; Intelligent infrastructures; IoT; Seaport; Security solutions; Smart port; Intrusion detection,ITU-BTS; ITU-Turkcell,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174796946

To this end, digital twin (DT) technology in the fifth-generation (5G) networks and drone-assisted data collection can be combined to provide precise ship maneuvering.

Looking back on all the installed risers worldwide in the last 3 decades, the steel catenary risers tend to be designed conservatively to accommodate the requirements in applicable codes and standards. There are several riser types adopted for offshore oil and gas production, which includes steel catenary risers (SCRs), top tensioned risers, flexible risers and hybrid riser systems. However, the SCRs, with a simple configuration and low fabrication and installation cost, is the most installed riser configuration for deepwater oil and gas production worldwide in the last 3 decades. SCRs have been facing more challenging environment (e.g., large OD gas export SCRs, and HPHT applications SCRs) and requests for longer service life (e.g., 30 years’ design life). Regulatory bodies (e.g., BSEE in GoM) prefer riser operations to be managed through an integrity management program, demonstrating that a continuous feedback of conditions of risers throughout their service life are in place with their field data maintained in a robust framework, especially for riser life extension applications. This paper investigates the integrity management program for Lingshui 17-2 SCRs that are designed for 30 years of continuous service life in South China Sea. The Lingshui 17-2 riser integrity management (RIM) program starts with reviewing the basis of design, global strength and fatigue performance, and installation analysis results. With the understanding of the global performance, a reliable and robust measurement system for monitoring key SCR performance parameters is proposed; these include vessel motion measurement in six degree of freedom, measurement of SCR top hang-off angles and tension, and full water column current measurement using ADCP. Sampling production fluid as well as documenting fluid data for indicative internal corrosion measurement are also planned. An initial maintenance plan with ROV inspection is established based on the understanding of the design data. A further plan to convert the collected measurement data into riser digital twin analysis input is outlined in this paper. The riser digital twin is part of the existing ABS integrated hull structure-mooring-riser digital twin service.

Riggers responsible for container lashing secure a high amount of containers on the ship while working with heavy equipment on a tight schedule and therefore risking musculoskeletal disorders. In addition there is a gap discovered between the learned practices at the training facility and the behavior applied on the work floor. As a result it is necessary to provide a risk assessment tool for maritime workers. Firstly, non-intrusive motion capture method can be used to map their posture and movements with the possibility to emphasize on causing factors of repetitive strain injuries. Secondly, a DHM representing the rigger in maritime environment is created in Blender. Finally, an inertial mocap system is used to monitor kinematic lashing movements and to create a musculoskeletal model.

The realization of high-performance manufacturing of equipment is particularly critical, and the assembly is the key link. The continuous expansion of application requirements and the continuous improvement of service performance have resulted in increased difficulty and complexity of assembly. Currently, it is a challenge to effectively realize the initial assembly performance of equipment and its long-term stability. The traditional way of assembly is driven by experience and geometric tolerances have certain randomness and uncertainty. These issues result in low assembly efficiency and accuracy and low one-time pass rate. In service, the service performance is inconsistent with the initial assembly performance, resulting in abnormal vibration or failure of equipment. Thus, performance-oriented digital twin (DT) assembly can overcome the shortcomings of traditional assembly under the high assembly performance (HAP) requirements of high-end equipment. The DT can potentially realize the HAP of high-end equipment using real-time mapping and control of physical entities in virtual space through virtual–real interaction, data fusion, iterative optimization, and other means. However, the performance-oriented DT assembly technology lacks systematic research. Thus, this paper expounds on the connotation of performance-oriented DT assembly technology based on the research status of high-end equipment assembly technology. This article presents a technical framework for performance-oriented DT assembly and discusses the realization approach and key technologies of performance-oriented DT assembly. Finally, its research direction and suggestions are given. The research will reveal the urgent engineering problems of performance-driven active and accurate assembly of high-end equipment and provide a reference for improving assembly performance, consistency, and efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Assembly performance; Digital twin; High-end equipment; Performance modeling; Reverse process parameters,Assembly performance; Assembly technology; High-end equipment; Performance; Performance Modeling; Performance-oriented; Process parameters; Reverse process; Reverse process parameter; Service performance; Data fusion,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875081, 51935003, 52005081, U22A20203); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2017-VII-0010–0105)",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153527343

With increasing international concern about emissions and the rise in oil prices, improvements in engine efficiency are urgently needed. In the present work, a zero-dimensional model for a low-speed two-stroke diesel engine is developed that considers the exhaust gas bypass and geometry structures for the gas exchange model. The model was applied to a low-speed two-stroke 7G80 ME-C9 marine diesel engine and validated with engine shop test data, which consisted of the main engine performance parameters and cylinder pressure diagrams at different loads. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, the model has the ability to predict engine performance with good accuracy. After model validation, the variations in compression ratio, fuel injection timing, exhaust gas bypass valve opening portion, exhaust valve opening timing, and exhaust valve closing timing effects on engine performance were tested. Finally, the influence level of different parameters on engine performance was summarized, which can be used as a reference to determine the reasons for high fuel consumption in some cases. The developed engine performance model is considerable in digital twins for performance simulation, health management, and optimization. © 2023 by the authors.",diesel engine; engine performance; simulation; two-stroke; zero-dimensional,Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Gases; Marine engines; Engine performance; Gas bypass; Low speed; Simulation; Two-stroke; Two-stroke diesel engine; Two-stroke marine diesel engines; Valve opening; Zero-dimensional; Zero-dimensional models; Diesel engines,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151391759

One of the most attractive aspects is the concept of digital twins, which refers to digital replicas of physical assets, processes, and systems that can be used as advanced tools for design, operation, and maintenance. This article introduces the development of the digital twin of the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus in Norway, which will be a significant scientific and operational achievement for the maritime industry, making efficient and safe offshore operations possible. It enables data exchange safely and easily among different subsystems, modules, and various applications. Thus, the twin ship can provide an integrated view of the ship's various physical and behavioral aspects in different stages and allow simultaneous optimization of functional performance requirements. In addition, it enables advanced control and optimization, e.g., creating more reliable prediction for flexible objectives (time, output, emissions, fuel consumption), and executing day-Ahead and long-Term planning for operations.

The literature is especially sparse for system tests where multiple failures occur and interact. In this work, a laboratory-level experiment is conducted to mimic many of the properties of larger and more complex marine structures with redundant load paths, failure interaction, and component-to-system level integration. In the experiment, such properties are reflected by a hexagon tension specimen with four propagating fatigue cracks tested under displacement-controlled loading. The applied loading cycles and corresponding crack lengths are recorded as the major time-varying data of degradation, with the resisting force at maximum extension used as the system capacity. A novel computer vision method is used to measure the crack length. Strain gauges are also used to monitor the structure's status. The experimental data is presented and analyzed in this paper.

We propose a RL method enhanced by DT to address the integrated scheduling problem in ACTs. The RL model is trained in a DT-based simulation environment, which is more accurate and real-time than traditional simulations. This approach allows for easy transfer of the RL model to a real-world environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present an experiment in this paper.

Then, A dynamic cooperative speed regulation strategy for a group intelligence-oriented multi-ART (Artificial Intelligence Robot of Transportation) is proposed to realize the smart and distributed traffic control of container terminals. Via the real-time data interchange and message passing with ART group, the individual ART implements the collaborative speed regulation with the combination of the dynamic speed regulation strategy. Through the above-mentioned method, the sequence of ARTs arriving at the quay can be adjusted, which can decrease the waiting time of ARTs at the quay. Considering the consistency problem of individual and group agent among the dynamic speed regulation of ARTs, a novel distributed consensus protocol is established to assure that the individual status of ART will tend to converge basically during the collaborative speed regulation process, and the convergence of system can be guaranteed.

Providing seamless connectivity to users in different areas is envisioned as a promising solution, especially in remote areas and for marine communication. However, when jointly used with terrestrial networks composing satellite-terrestrial networks, the satellite moving speed is much faster than the ground terminal, which can cause inconsistent service from a single satellite, and therefore lead to frequent satellite handover. Moreover, due to the dynamic and time slot visibility of satellites, the topology of an intersatellite changes frequently, which results in loops during satellite handover, thereby reducing the utilization of links. To address these problems, we propose a digital twin-assisted storage strategy for satellite-terrestrial networks (INTERLINK), which leverages the digital twins (DTs) to map the satellite networks to virtual space for better communication. Specifically, we first propose a satellite storage-oriented handover scheme to minimize the handover frequency by considering the limited access time and capacity constraints of satellites. Then, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimal satellite by genetic algorithm. Finally, considering the timing visibility of the satellite links, a digital twin-assisted intersatellite routing scheme is introduced to improve the quality of data delivery between satellites. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed INTERLINK can reduce both handover times and average propagation delay compared with its counterparts. Meanwhile, benefitting from integrated DT, both the quality of data delivery and the delay of intersatellite links are considerably improved.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.",Digital twins (DTs); intersatellite routing; multiobjective optimization; satellite handover; satellite-terrestrial network (STN),Communication satellites; Digital storage; Earth (planet); Genetic algorithms; Network routing; Orbits; Satellite communication systems; Satellite links; Visibility; Delay; Hand over; Intersatellite routing; Low earth orbit satellites; Multi-objectives optimization; Routings; Satellite handover; Satellite-terrestrial network; Space vehicles; Multiobjective optimization,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128663123

In a twin-crane system, cranes must travel with a minimum safety distance between them to prevent interference. The crane trajectory prediction is critical to interference handling and crane scheduling. Current trajectory predictions lack accuracy because many details are simplified. To enhance accuracy and lessen the trajectory prediction time, a trajectory prediction approach with details (crane acceleration/deceleration, different crane velocities when loading/unloading, and trolley movement) is proposed in this paper. Simulations on different details and their combinations are conducted on a container terminal case study. According to the simulation results, the accuracy of the trajectory prediction can be improved by 20%.

Bolted joints play a crucial role in connecting these laminates. However, manufacturing variations arise during the assembly process, impacting performance due to material-related factors. Predicting the assembly stress fields of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer bolted joints is of great significance in design optimization, manufacturing process control, and structural health monitoring. The currently prevalent finite element analysis methods incur extremely high computational costs, failing to meet the requirements for real-time prediction of the assembly and multiparametric design of composite bolted joints. Proposing a methodological framework for rapidly predicting the assembly physical field is necessary. This paper introduces a stress prediction framework to enhance analysis and aid material parameter design. The framework is inspired by image processing and artificial intelligence drawing by analogizing the computed physical field results to the generated images. Therefore, the Bolted Tightening Generative Adversarial Network (BT-GAN), a cascaded generative model, is proposed in this paper to predict stress fields of the composite bolted joints during assembly. The model starts with data augmentation of the stress filed results from the finite element analysis in a super-resolution network, which realizes an integral interpolation mapping from coarse-grid to fine-grid results. Then, the results of the data enhancement are fed into the subsequent conditional generative adversarial network for learning. Similar to the text-guided image generation approach, the network learns to understand the physical mapping relationships between different parameters and assembly stress fields. Moreover, the network achieves higher accuracy in stress field prediction by extraction the understanding of multi-scale features through the skip connection and the attention mechanism. This method effectively learns the physical mapping relationship between multiple parameters and the stress field, applying a graph generation approach to end-to-end predictions of the field. Compared to the results of finite element analysis from the coarse-grid, the Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the cascaded generative network proposed in this paper has been improved from 0.584 to 0.962 and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric has been increased from 17.3 dB to 58.2 dB. What's more, the mean relative error on the maximum values of the stress field has reached 6.9%. The trained model takes only 6.1s to complete a single prediction, significantly improving the prediction efficiency compared with finite element analysis. It is compared with the other networks commonly used for physical field prediction and shows improvement in the metrics proposed in the article. By constructing such an end-to-end stress field prediction framework during assembly, efficient forecasting for the assembly of composite bolted joints can be achieved. This is advantageous for the digital twin modeling of the assembly lines and the effective control of assembly quality, providing a powerful tool for assembly design and analysis. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Composite bolted joints; Conditional generative adversarial network; Data augmentation; End-to-end prediction of stress fields; Surrogate model,Bolted joints; Bolts; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Image processing; Laminated composites; Mapping; Signal to noise ratio; Stresses; Structural health monitoring; Composite bolted joints; Conditional generative adversarial network; Data augmentation; End to end; End-to-end prediction of stress field; Finite element analyse; Generative model; Physical field; Stress field; Surrogate modeling; Forecasting,"Center for High Performance Computing, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU HPC; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFA0709001, 2022YFF0605700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975349); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194581745

However, the previous studies have not adequately recognized the specific impacts of COVID-19 on maritime transportation. In this study, a series of analyses of the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), the China Coastal Bulk Freight Index (CCBFI) and of container throughputs with and without the impact of COVID-19 were carried out to assess changing trends in dry bulk and container transportation. The results show that global dry bulk transportation was largely affected by lockdown policies in the second month during COVID-19, and BDI presented a year-on-year decrease of approximately 35.5% from 2019 to 2020. The CCBFI showed an upward trend in the second month during COVID-19, one month ahead of the BDI. The container throughputs at Shanghai Port, the Ports of Hong Kong, the Ports of Singapore and the Ports of Los Angeles from 2019 to 2020 presented the largest year-on-year drops of approximately 19.6%, 7.1%, 10.6% and 30.9%, respectively. In addition, the authors developed exponential smoothing models of BDI, CCBFI, and container transportation, and calculated the percentage prediction error between the observed and predicted values to examine the impact of exogenous effects on the shipping industry due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The results are consistent with the conclusions obtained from the comparison of BDI, CCBFI, and container transportation during the same period in 2020 and 2019. Finally, on the basis of the findings, smart shipping and special support policies are proposed to reduce the negative impacts of COVID-19.",COVID-19 pandemic; Urban lockdown policy; Dry bulk transportation; Container transportation; Exponential smoothing model,BALTIC DRY INDEX; CONTAINER; ERROR,National Natural Science Foundation of China [12072195]; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [16ZDA048],Article,,,,

It is critical to establish fast-response marine power models to evaluate various green power-driven power components. However, when evaluating a finite model, the calculating often requires re-meshing of the model once the model parameters change, resulting in huge amount computing costs. The reduced-order model can address this issue by rapid calculation of the model responses; however, real-time computing of the reduced-order model is still a challenging task. In this paper, we study the basic principle of the digital twin reduced-order model and propose a digital twin reduced-order model. Firstly, the geometric model of a marine centrifugal pump is imported into ICEM meshing software for calculation domain meshing; Secondly, import the mesh file generated by ICEM software into Fluent for CFD numerical simulation and numerical simulation of the reduced-order model; finally, the reduced-order model is verified: under the rated working condition, the calculated head of reduced-order model is 31.98 m, the maximum speed of impeller edge is 24.4 m/s, and the minimum speed at the impeller shaft center is 0.0475 m/s. The errors are less than 1% compared to the theoretically calculated values.

The proposed DSS assesses the resilience of a port under possible disruptive events given its design, operations and potential pre-defined post-event recovery actions to mitigate the impact of the disruption. Digital twinning provides the fidelity required to realistically predict port performance with taken post-event recovery actions under various possible disruptive events. In addition to hedging against impacts from probabilistically known disruption events, this approach also enables inclusion of ordinary operational uncertainties within the resilience evaluation. This is not generally feasible with other existing resilience quantification approaches. To tackle computational challenges of applying a digital twin for real-world size applications, an optimal computing budget allocation policy is adopted to improve computational efficiency. Results of numerical experiments using a real-world size port demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSS and criticality of accounting for ordinary uncertainties in operations in resilience estimation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Decision support systems; Digital-twinning-driven analytics; Maritime transport; Port performance; Port resilience; Simulation-optimization,Budget control; Computational efficiency; Digital twin; Uncertainty analysis; Computational challenges; Decision support system (dss); Disruptive event; Modern tools; Numerical experiments; Optimal computing budget allocation; Real-world; Recovery actions; Decision support systems,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMS-1923145); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-19-1-0383); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61603321, 71720107003); Singapore Maritime Institute, SMI, (SMI-2018-PE-01)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100029081

Many studies have shown that discrete event simulation (DES) is useful to simulate complex systems. DES can be utilized as a digital twin which not only replays the history, but also tests “what-if” scenarios. For complex systems such as the container terminal, digital twin is the only way to explore various ideas and strategies on design, planning and operation levels, and even optimization methods to further improve the operation efficiency. However, most of commercial software for DES are closed software which users can only play within build-in functions and are difficult to extend for other purposes. To address these limitations, an object-oriented DES modeling framework – O2DES.Net – is employed to develop terminal digital twin and traffic digital twin. The scalability, modularity and open structure features of O2DES.Net ensure that the digital twins can focus on not only equipment mechanism but also system performance for various terminal concepts. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.
